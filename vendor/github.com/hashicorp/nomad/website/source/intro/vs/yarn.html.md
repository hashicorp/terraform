# Nomad vs. Hadoop YARN

YARN, or Yet Another Resource Negotiator, is a system in Hadoop
for both resource management and job scheduling. It is used to allow multiple
Hadoop frameworks like MapReduce and Spark to run on the same hardware.

Nomad is focused on both long-lived services and batch workloads, and
is designed to be a platform for running large scale applications
generally instead of specifically for Hadoop.
