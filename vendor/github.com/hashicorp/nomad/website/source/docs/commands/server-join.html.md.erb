# Command: server-join

The `server-join` command joins the local server to one or more Nomad servers.
Joining is only required for server nodes, and only needs to succeed against
one or more of the provided addresses. Once joined, the gossip layer will
handle discovery of the other server nodes in the cluster.

## Usage

```
nomad server-join [options] <addr> [<addr>...]
```

One or more server addresses are required. If multiple server addresses are
specified, then an attempt will be made to join each one. If one or more nodes
are joined successfully, the exit code will be 0. Otherwise, the exit code will
be 1.

## Examples

Join the local server to a remote server:

```
$ nomad server-join 10.0.0.8:4648
Joined 1 servers successfully
```
