  The eval-status command is used to see the status and potential failed
  allocations of an evaluation.

# Command: eval-status

The `eval-status` command is used to display information about an existing
evaluation. In the case an evaluation could not place all the requested
allocations, this command can be used to determine the failure reasons.

Optionally, it can also be invoked in a monitor mode to track an outstanding
evaluation. In this mode, ogs will be output describing state changes to the
evaluation or its associated allocations. The monitor will exit when the
evaluation reaches a terminal state.

## Usage

```
nomad eval-status [options] <eval>
```

An evaluation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
the status  will be shown. Otherwise, a list of matching evaluations and
information will be displayed.

If the `-monitor` flag is passed, an interactive monitoring session will be
started in the terminal. It is safe to exit the monitor at any time using
ctrl+c. The command will exit when the given evaluation reaches a terminal
state (completed or failed). Exit code 0 is returned on successful
evaluation, and if there are no scheduling problems. If there are
job placement issues encountered (unsatisfiable constraints,
resource exhaustion, etc), then the exit code will be 2. Any other
errors, including client connection issues or internal errors, are
indicated by exit code 1.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Eval Status Options

* `-monitor`: Monitor an outstanding evaluation

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

* `-json` : Output the evaluation in its JSON format.

* `-t` : Format and display evaluation using a Go template.

## Examples

Show the status of an evaluation that has placement failures

```
$ nomad eval-status 2ae0e6a5
ID                 = 2ae0e6a5
Status             = complete
Status Description = complete
Type               = service
TriggeredBy        = job-register
Job ID             = example
Priority           = 50
Placement Failures = true

==> Failed Placements
Task Group "cache" (failed to place 1 allocation):
  * Class "foo" filtered 1 nodes
  * Constraint "${attr.kernel.name} = windows" filtered 1 nodes


Evaluation "67493a64" waiting for additional capacity to place remainder
```

Monitor an existing evaluation

```
$ nomad eval-status -monitor 8262bc83
==> Monitoring evaluation "8262bc83"
    Allocation "bd6bd0de" created: node "6f299da5", group "group1"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "8262bc83" finished with status "complete"
```
