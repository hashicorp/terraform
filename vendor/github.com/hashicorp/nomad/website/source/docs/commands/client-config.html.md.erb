# Command: client-config

The `client-config` command is used to view or modify client configuration
details. This command only works on client nodes, and can be used to update
the running client configurations it supports.

## Usage

```
nomad client-config [options]
```

The arguments behave differently depending on the flags given. See each flag's
description below for specific usage information and requirements.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Client Config Options

* `-servers`: List the client's known servers. Client nodes do not participate
  in the gossip pool, and instead register with these servers periodically over
  the network. The initial value of this list may come from configuration files
  using the [servers](/docs/agent/config.html#servers) configuration option in
  the client block.

* `-update-servers`: Updates the client's server list using the provided
  arguments. Multiple server addresses may be passed using multiple arguments.
  When updating the servers list, you must specify ALL of the server nodes you
  wish to configure. The set is updated atomically. It is an error to specify
  this flag without any server addresses. If you do _not_ specify a port for each
  server address, the default port `4647` will be used.

## Examples

Query the currently known servers:

```
$ nomad client-config -servers
server1:4647
server2:4647
```

Update the list of servers:

```
$ nomad client-config -update-servers server1:4647 server2:4647 server3:4647 server4
```
