Write a short description of the user-facing change. Examples:

- `terraform show -json`: Fixed crash with sensitive set values.
- When rendering a diff, Terraform now quotes the name of any object attribute whose string representation is not a valid identifier.
- The local token configuration in the cloud and remote backend now has higher priority than a token specified in a credentials block in the CLI configuration.
