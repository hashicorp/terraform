# This workflow is a collection of "quick checks" that should be reasonable
# to run for any new commit to this repository in principle.
#
# The main purpose of this workflow is to represent checks that we want to
# run prior to reviewing and merging a pull request. We should therefore aim
# for these checks to complete in no more than a few minutes in the common
# case.
#
# The build.yml workflow includes some additional checks we run only for
# already-merged changes to release branches and tags, as a compromise to
# keep the PR feedback relatively fast. The intent is that checks.yml should
# catch most problems but that build.yml might occasionally by the one to catch
# more esoteric situations, such as architecture-specific or OS-specific
# misbehavior.
