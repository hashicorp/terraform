Licensor:             HashiCorp, Inc.
Licensed Work:        Terraform Version 1.6.0 or later. The Licensed Work is (c) 2024
                      HashiCorp, Inc.
Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided
                      Your use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third
                      parties on a hosted or embedded basis in order to compete with 
                      HashiCorp's paid version(s) of the Licensed Work. For purposes 
                      of this license:

                      A "competitive offering" is a Product that is offered to third
                      parties on a paid basis, including through paid support 
                      arrangements, that significantly overlaps with the capabilities 
                      of HashiCorp's paid version(s) of the Licensed Work. If Your 
                      Product is not a competitive offering when You first make it 
                      generally available, it will not become a competitive offering
                      later due to HashiCorp releasing a new version of the Licensed 
                      Work with additional capabilities. In addition, Products that 
                      are not provided on a paid basis are not competitive.

                      "Product" means software that is offered to end users to manage 
                      in their own environments or offered as a service on a hosted 
                      basis.

                      "Embedded" means including the source code or executable code 
                      from the Licensed Work in a competitive offering. "Embedded" 
                      also means packaging the competitive offering in such a way 
                      that the Licensed Work must be accessed or downloaded for the 
                      competitive offering to operate.

                      Hosting or using the Licensed Work(s) for internal purposes 
                      within an organization is not considered a competitive 
                      offering. HashiCorp considers your organization to include all 
                      of your affiliates under common control.
