# HCL

HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built
by HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language
that is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but
specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.

HCL is also fully JSON compatible. That is, JSON can be used as completely
valid input to a system expecting HCL. This helps makes systems
interoperable with other systems.

HCL is heavily inspired by
[libucl](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl),
nginx configuration, and others similar.

## Why?

A common question when viewing HCL is to ask the question: why not
JSON, YAML, etc.?

Prior to HCL, the tools we built at [HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com)
used a variety of configuration languages from full programming languages
such as Ruby to complete data structure languages such as JSON. What we
learned is that some people wanted human-friendly configuration languages
and some people wanted machine-friendly languages.

JSON fits a nice balance in this, but is fairly verbose and most
importantly doesn't support comments. With YAML, we found that beginners
had a really hard time determining what the actual structure was, and
ended up guessing more than not whether to use a hyphen, colon, etc.
in order to represent some configuration key.

Full programming languages such as Ruby enable complex behavior
a configuration language shouldn't usually allow, and also forces
people to learn some set of Ruby.

Because of this, we decided to create our own configuration language
that is JSON-compatible. Our configuration language (HCL) is designed
to be written and modified by humans. The API for HCL allows JSON
as an input so that it is also machine-friendly (machines can generate
JSON instead of trying to generate HCL).

Our goal with HCL is not to alienate other configuration languages.
It is instead to provide HCL as a specialized language for our tools,
and JSON as the interoperability layer.

## Syntax

The complete grammar
[can be found here](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/master/hcl/parse.y),
if you're more comfortable reading specifics, but a high-level overview
of the syntax and grammar are listed here.

  * Single line comments start with `#` or `//`

  * Multi-line comments are wrapped in `/*` and `*/`

  * Values are assigned with the syntax `key = value` (whitespace doesn't
    matter). The value can be any primitive: a string, number, boolean,
    object, or list.

  * Strings are double-quoted and can contain any UTF-8 characters.
    Example: `"Hello, World"`

  * Numbers are assumed to be base 10. If you prefix a number with 0x,
    it is treated as a hexadecimal. If it is prefixed with 0, it is
    treated as an octal. Numbers can be in scientific notation: "1e10".

  * Boolean values: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`.

  * Arrays can be made by wrapping it in `[]`. Example:
    `["foo", "bar", 42]`. Arrays can contain primitives
    and other arrays, but cannot contain objects. Objects must
    use the block syntax shown below.

Objects and nested objects are created using the structure shown below:

```
variable "ami" {
    description = "the AMI to use"
}
```
