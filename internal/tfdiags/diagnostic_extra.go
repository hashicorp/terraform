// This "Extra" idea is something we've inherited from HCL's diagnostic model,
// and so it's primarily to expose that functionality from wrapped HCL
// diagnostics but other diagnostic types could potentially implement this
// protocol too, if needed.

// ExtraInfo tries to retrieve extra information of interface type T from
// the given diagnostic.
//
// "Extra information" is situation-specific additional contextual data which
// might allow for some special tailored reporting of particular
// diagnostics in the UI. Conventionally the extra information is provided
// as a hidden type that implements one or more interfaces which a caller
// can pass as type parameter T to retrieve a value of that type when the
// diagnostic has such an implementation.
//
// If the given diagnostic's extra value has an implementation of interface T
// then ExtraInfo returns a non-nil interface value. If there is no such
// implementation, ExtraInfo returns a nil T.
//
// Although the signature of this function does not constrain T to be an
// interface type, our convention is to only use interface types to access
// extra info in order to allow for alternative or wrapping implementations
// of the interface.

// ExtraInfoNext takes a value previously returned by ExtraInfo and attempts
// to find an implementation of interface T wrapped inside of it. The return
// value meaning is the same as for ExtraInfo.
//
// This is to help with the less common situation where a particular "extra"
// value might be wrapping another value implementing the same interface,
// and so callers can peel away one layer at a time until there are no more
// nested layers.
//
// Because this function is intended for searching for _nested_ implementations
// of T, ExtraInfoNext does not consider whether value "previous" directly
// implements interface T, on the assumption that the previous call to ExtraInfo
// with the same T caused "previous" to already be that result.
