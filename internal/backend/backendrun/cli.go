// CLI is an optional interface that can be implemented to be initialized
// with information from the Terraform CLI. If this is implemented, this
// initialization function will be called with data to help interact better
// with a CLI.
//
// This interface was created to improve backend interaction with the
// official Terraform CLI while making it optional for API users to have
// to provide full CLI interaction to every backend.
//
// If you're implementing a Backend, it is acceptable to require CLI
// initialization. In this case, your backend should be coded to error
// on other methods (such as State, Operation) if CLI initialization was not
// done with all required fields.

	// whether they should be overwritten or not.

// Your backend should be documented clearly to explain to end users what
// options have an affect and what won't. In some cases, it may even make sense
// to error in your backend when an option is set so that users don't make
// a critically incorrect assumption about behavior.
