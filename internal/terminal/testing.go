// StreamsForTesting is a helper for test code that is aiming to test functions
// that interact with the input and output streams.
//
// This particular function is for the simple case of a function that only
// produces output: the returned input stream is connected to the system's
// "null device", as if a user had run Terraform with I/O redirection like
// </dev/null on Unix. It also configures the output as a pipe rather than
// as a terminal, and so can't be used to test whether code is able to adapt
// to different terminal widths.
//
// The return values are a Streams object ready to pass into a function under
// test, and a callback function for the test itself to call afterwards
// in order to obtain any characters that were written to the streams. Once
// you call the close function, the Streams object becomes invalid and must
// not be used anymore. Any caller of this function _must_ call close before
// its test concludes, even if it doesn't intend to check the output, or else
// it will leak resources.
//
// Since this function is for testing only, for convenience it will react to
// any setup errors by logging a message to the given testing.T object and
// then failing the test, preventing any later code from running.

	// that we'll want some other similar helpers for more complicated
	// situations, such as codepaths that need to read from Stdin or
	// tests for whether a function responds properly to terminal width.
	// In that case, we'd probably want to factor out the core guts of this
	// which set up the pipe *os.File values and the goroutines, but then
	// let each caller produce its own Streams wrapping around those. For
	// now though, it's simpler to just have this whole implementation together
	// in one function.)

	// Our idea of streams is only a very thin wrapper around OS-level file
