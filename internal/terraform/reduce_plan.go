// performed by a specific graph node.
//
// Callers must specify whether they are a destroy node or a regular apply node.
// If the result is NoOp then the given change requires no action for the
// specific graph node calling this and so evaluation of the that graph node
// should exit early and take no action.
//
// The returned object may either be identical to the input change or a new
// change object derived from the input. Because of the former case, the caller
// must not mutate the object returned in OutChange.
