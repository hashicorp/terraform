This virtual source package contains test fixtures for integration testing
of the overall planning phase.

The test configurations in here are typically intended only for one or two
specific tests, and we should prefer to create more simple test fixtures rather
than trying to share test fixtures too freely between different tests and thus
make it harder to understand what exactly they are testing.
