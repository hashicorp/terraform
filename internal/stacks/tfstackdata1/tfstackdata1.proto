///////////// PLAN SEQUENCE MESSAGES
//
// A "stack plan" consists of a sequence of messages emitted gradually from
// the streaming Stacks.PlanStackChanges RPC in the Terraform Core RPC API.
//
// From the perspective of that protocol the objects in the sequence are
// opaque and to be preserved byte-for-byte without any external interpretation,
// in the same order they were emitted from Terraform Core.
//
// Internally, we decode each one based on the type field of google.protobuf.Any,
// treating each one as some kind of mutation of our in-memory plan data
// structure.
//
// These message types only cover the data that Terraform needs to apply the
// plan, and so don't cover any information that Terraform Core might emit
// only for the caller's benefit.
//////////////

// Appears early in a raw plan sequence to capture some metadata that we need
// to process subsequent messages, or to abort if we're being asked to decode
// a plan created by a different version of Terraform.

    // The canonical version string for the version of Terraform that created
    // the plan sequence that this message belongs to.
    //
    // The raw plan sequence loader will fail if it finds a message of this
    // type with a version string that disagrees with the version of Terraform
    // decoding the message, because we always expect plans to be applied by
    // the same version of Terraform that created them.

// Confirms whether the overall plan whose raw plan sequence includes this
// message is complete enough and valid enough to be applied.
//
// If a the sequence of raw plan messages includes multiple messages of this
// type then the one with the latest position in the list "wins" during
// decoding of the overall sequence, although in practice there isn't yet
// any clear reason to include more than one instance of this message type in a

///////////// STATE MAP MESSAGES
//
// A "stack state snapshot" is a mapping from arbitrary keys to messages
// emitted gradually from the streaming Stacks.ApplyStackChanges RPC in the
// Terraform Core RPC API.
//
// From the perspective of that protocol the keys and values in the map are
// opaque and to be preserved verbatim without any external interpretation,
// overwriting any previous value that had the same key.
//
// Internally, we decode each one based on the type field of google.protobuf.Any,
// treating each one as some kind of mutation of our in-memory plan data
// structure.
//
// These message types only cover the data that Terraform needs to produce
// a future plan based on this snapshot, and don't cover any information that
// Terraform Core might emit only for the caller's benefit.
//
// Because state messages survive from one run to the next, all top-level
// messages used for state snapshots have a format version suffix that is
// currently always 1. The functions that load a state map into the in-memory
// state structure will fail if any of the messages are of an unknown type, so
// we should increment the format version only as a last resort because this
// will prevent users from downgrading to an earlier version of Terraform once
// they've got at least one state map message that is of a newer version.
//////////////

// Represents the existence of a particular component instance.
//
// This is here just to remove the ambiguity between a component instance that
// exists but contains no resource instances vs. a component instance that
// doesn't exist at all.
//
// Because the state map is updated on a per-element basis rather than
// atomically, it's possible that the state map might contain resource instances
// which belong to a component instance that is not tracked by a message of
// this type. In that case, the state loader will just assume an implied
// message of this type with a matching component instance address and with
// all other fields unset.
message StateComponentInstanceV1 {
    // No details to track yet. The presence of an instance of this message
    // at all is the signal of the component instance's existence.
}

// Represents the existence of a particular resource instance object in a
// particular component instance.
//
// A resource instance message object should typically be accompanied by a
// StateComponentInstanceV1 (or later version) that represents the existence
// of the component itself, but for robustness we tolerate the absense of
// such a message and just assume that all of its fields (other than the
// component instance address) are unset.
message StateResourceInstanceObjectV1 {
    // value_json is a JSON representation of the object value representing
    // this resource instance object.
    //
    // This is JSON-serialized rather than MessagePack serialized (as we do
    // for everything else in this format and in the RPC API) because
    // the provider protocol only supports legacy flatmap and JSON as input
    // to the state upgrade process, and we won't be able to transcode from
    // MessagePack to JSON once we decode this because we won't know the
    // schema that the value was encoded with.
