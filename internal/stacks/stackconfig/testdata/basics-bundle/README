This directory is a source bundle set up to behave as though it contains
the following remote source packages:

- git::https://example.com/root.git
- git::https://example.com/nested.git

The bundle also recognizes the following module registry address mapping:

- example.com/awesomecorp/nested/happycloud@1.0.0 -> git::https://example.com/nested.git//subdir
- example.com/awesomecorp/nested/happycloud@2.0.0 -> git::https://example.com/nested.git//intentionally-missing-v2

The following source addresses contain valid stack configurations when
interpreted trough this bundle:

- git::https://example.com/root.git
- git::https://example.com/nested.git//subdir
- example.com/awesomecorp/nested/happycloud if resolved with a version constraint that includes v1.0.0 and excludes v2.0.0

Requesting example.com/awesomecorp/nested/happycloud without a version
constraint that excludes v2.0.0 will select
git::https://example.com/nested.git//intentionally-missing-v2, which
as the name suggests is intentionally missing and so will cause configuration
loading to fail.

There's also a regular Terraform module at this address, usable as a component
implementation:

- git::https://example.com/nested.git
