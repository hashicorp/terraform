// Walker is used to walk every vertex of a graph in parallel.
//
// A vertex will only be walked when the dependencies of that vertex have
// been walked. If two vertices can be walked at the same time, they will be.
//
// Update can be called to update the graph. This can be called even during
// a walk, changing vertices/edges mid-walk. This should be done carefully.
// If a vertex is removed but has already been executed, the result of that
// execution (any error) is still returned by Wait. Changing or re-adding
// a vertex that has already executed has no effect. Changing edges of
// a vertex that has already executed has no effect.
//
// Non-parallelism can be enforced by introducing a lock in your callback
// function. However, the goroutine overhead of a walk will remain.
// Walker will create V*2 goroutines (one for each vertex, and dependency
// waiter for each vertex). In general this should be of no concern unless
// there are a huge number of vertices.
//
// The walk is depth first by default. This can be changed with the Reverse
// option.
//
// A single walker is only valid for one graph walk. After the walk is complete
// you must construct a new walker to walk again. State for the walk is never
// deleted in case vertices or edges are changed.
