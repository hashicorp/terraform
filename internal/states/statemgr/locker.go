// Locker is the interface for state managers that are able to manage
// mutual-exclusion locks for state.
//
// Implementing Locker alongside Persistent relaxes some of the usual
// implementation constraints for implementations of Refresher and Persister,
// under the assumption that the locking mechanism effectively prevents
// multiple Terraform processes from reading and writing state concurrently.
// In particular, a type that implements both Locker and Persistent is only
// required to that the Persistent implementation is concurrency-safe within
// a single Terraform process.
//
// A Locker implementation must ensure that another processes with a
// similarly-configured state manager cannot successfully obtain a lock while
// the current process is holding it, or vice-versa, assuming that both
// processes agree on the locking mechanism.
//
// A Locker is not required to prevent non-cooperating processes from
// concurrently modifying the state, but is free to do so as an extra
// protection. If a mandatory locking mechanism of this sort is implemented,
// the state manager must ensure that RefreshState and PersistState calls
// can succeed if made through the same manager instance that is holding the
// lock, such has by retaining some sort of lock token that the Persistent
// methods can then use.

	// retry lock acquisition periodically until a timeout is reached.
