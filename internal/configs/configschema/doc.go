// Package configschema contains types for describing the expected structure
// of a configuration block whose shape is not known until runtime.
//
// For example, this is used to describe the expected contents of a resource
// configuration block, which is defined by the corresponding provider plugin
// and thus not compiled into Terraform core.
//
// A configschema primarily describes the shape of configuration, but it is
// also suitable for use with other structures derived from the configuration,
// such as the cached state of a resource or a resource diff.
//
// This package should not be confused with the package helper/schema, which
// is the higher-level helper library used to implement providers themselves.
