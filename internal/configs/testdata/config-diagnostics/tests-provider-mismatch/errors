testdata/config-diagnostics/tests-provider-mismatch/main.tftest.hcl:27,11-14: Provider type mismatch; The local name "bar" in main.tftest.hcl represents provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/bar", but "foo" in the root module represents "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/foo".\n\nThis means the provider definition for "bar" within main.tftest.hcl, or other provider definitions with the same name, have been referenced by multiple run blocks and assigned to different provider types.
