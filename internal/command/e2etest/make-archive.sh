# For normal use this package can just be tested with "go test" as standard,
# but this script is an alternative to allow the tests to be run somewhere
# other than where they are built.

# The primary use for this is cross-compilation, where e.g. we can produce an
# archive that can be extracted on a Windows system to run the e2e tests there:
#    $ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 ./make-archive.sh
#
# This will produce a zip file build/terraform-e2etest_windows_amd64.zip which
# can be shipped off to a Windows amd64 system, extracted to some directory,
# and then executed as follows:
#    set TF_ACC=1
#    ./e2etest.exe
#
# Because separated e2etest harnesses are intended for testing against "real"
# release executables, the generated archives don't include a copy of
# the Terraform executable. Instead, the caller of the tests must retrieve
# and extract a release package into the working directory before running
# the e2etest executable, so that "e2etest" can find and execute it.
