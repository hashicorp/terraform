Error: Provider configuration not present

To work with test_resource.secondary its original provider configuration at
provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/test"].secondary is required, but it
has been removed. This occurs when a provider configuration is removed while
objects created by that provider still exist in the state. Re-add the provider
configuration to destroy test_resource.secondary, after which you can remove
the provider configuration again.
