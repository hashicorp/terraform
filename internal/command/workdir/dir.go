// Dir represents a single Terraform working directory.
//
// "Working directory" is unfortunately a slight misnomer, because non-default
// options can potentially stretch the definition such that multiple working
// directories end up appearing to share a data directory, or other similar
// anomolies, but we continue to use this terminology both for historical
// reasons and because it reflects the common case without any special
// overrides.
//
// The naming convention for methods on this type is that methods whose names
// begin with "Override" affect only characteristics of the particular object
// they're called on, changing where it looks for data, while methods whose
// names begin with "Set" will write settings to disk such that other instances
// referring to the same directories will also see them. Given that, the
// "Override" methods should be used only during the initialization steps
// for a Dir object, typically only inside "package main", so that all
// subsequent work elsewhere will access consistent locations on disk.
//
// We're gradually transitioning to using this type to manage working directory
// settings, and so not everything in the working directory "data dir" is
// encapsulated here yet, but hopefully we'll gradually migrate all of those
// settings here over time. The working directory state not yet managed in here
// is typically managed directly in the "command" package, either directly
// inside commands or in methods of the giant command.Meta type.
type Dir struct {
	// mainDir is the path to the directory that we present as the
	// "working directory" in the user model, which is typically the
	// current working directory when running Terraform CLI, or the
	// directory explicitly chosen by the user using the -chdir=...
	// global option.
	mainDir string

	// originalDir is the path to the working directory that was
	// selected when creating the Terraform CLI process, regardless of
	// -chdir=... being set. This is only for very limited purposes
	// related to backward compatibility; most functionality should
	// use mainDir instead.
	originalDir string

	// dataDir is the path to the directory where we will store our
	// working directory settings and artifacts. This is typically a
	// directory named ".terraform" within mainDir, but users may
	// override it.

// NewDir constructs a new working directory, anchored at the given path.
//
// In normal use, mainPath should be "." to reflect the current working
// directory, with "package main" having switched the process's current
// working directory if necessary prior to calling this function. However,
// unusual situations in tests may set mainPath to a temporary directory, or
// similar.
//
// WARNING: Although the logic in this package is intended to work regardless
// of whether mainPath is actually the current working directory, we're
// currently in a transitional state where this package shares responsibility
// for the working directory with various command.Meta methods, and those
// often assume that the main path of the working directory will always be
// ".". If you're writing test code that spans across both areas of
// responsibility then you must ensure that the test temporarily changes the
// test process's working directory to the directory returned by RootModuleDir
// before using the result inside a command.Meta.
