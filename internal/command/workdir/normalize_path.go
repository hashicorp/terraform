// NormalizePath attempts to transform the given path so that it's relative
// to the working directory, which is our preferred way to present and store
// paths to files and directories within a configuration so that they can
// be portable to operations in other working directories.
//
// It isn't always possible to produce a relative path. For example, on Windows
// the given path might be on a different volume (e.g. drive letter or network
// share) than the working directory.
//
// Note that the result will be relative to the main directory of the receiver,
// which should always be the actual process working directory in normal code,
// but might be some other temporary working directory when in test code.
// If you need to access the file or directory that the result refers to with
// functions that aren't aware of our base directory, you can use something
// like the following, which again should be needed only in test code which
// might need to inspect the filesystem in order to make assertions:
//
//	filepath.Join(d.RootModuleDir(), normalizePathResult)
//
// The above is suitable only for situations where the given path is known
// to be beneath the working directory, which is the typical situation for
// temporary working directories created for automated tests.
