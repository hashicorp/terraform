# This script rewrites [GH-nnnn]-style references in the CHANGELOG.md file to
# be Markdown links to the given github issues.
#
# This is run during releases so that the issue references in all of the
# released items are presented as clickable links, but we can just use the
# easy [GH-nnnn] shorthand for quickly adding items to the "Unrelease" section
# while merging things between releases.
