# Destroy Best Practices
Added a new documentation page "Destroy Best Practices" to provide guidance for safely using `terraform destroy`, including:
- Using `-target` carefully
- Reviewing the plan before destruction
- Protecting critical resources with `prevent_destroy`
- Backing up state files
- Managing workspaces
- Team confirmation and coordination
