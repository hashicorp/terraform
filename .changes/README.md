# Changelog process

We use [Changie](https://changie.dev/) to manage our changelog. 
We support PRs to three branches, which all have their own changelog folders:

- **N-1**: latest maintenance release -> `.changes/current`
- **N**: upcoming release -> `.changes/next`
- **N+1**: next release -> `.changes/dev`
