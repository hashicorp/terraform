  Module dependency locking is now supported in .terraform.lock.hcl files alongside provider dependency locks.
  
  Modules are now validated with hash checks to ensure reproducible builds and detect module tampering. 
  Multiple hashes are supported to handle registry inconsistencies, following the same pattern as providers.
  
  Hash validation prevents lock file updates when module content doesn't match expected hashes, unless 
  using the -upgrade flag to explicitly allow new hashes to be accumulated.
