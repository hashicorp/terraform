body: "Terraform Actions: Actions allow you to codify side-effects in your Terraform config. Providers can define Actions like `aws_lambda_invoke` or `aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation` that do something imparative outside of Terraforms normal CRUD model. You can configure such a side-effect with an action block and have actions triggered through the lifecycle of a resource or through passing the `-invoke` CLI flag."
