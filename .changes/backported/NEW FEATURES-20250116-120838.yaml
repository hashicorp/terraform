kind: NEW FEATURES
body: S3 native state locking is now generally available. The `use_lockfile` argument enables users to adopt the S3-native mechanism for state locking. As part of this change, we've deprecated the DynamoDB-related arguments in favor of this new locking mechanism. While you can still use DynamoDB alongside S3-native state locking for migration purposes, we encourage migrating to the new state locking mechanism.
