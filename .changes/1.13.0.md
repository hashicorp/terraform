## 1.13.0 (August 20, 2025)


NEW FEATURES:

* The new command `terraform stacks` exposes some stack operations through the cli. The available subcommands depend on the stacks plugin implementation. Use `terraform stacks -help` to see available commands. ([#36931](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/36931))


ENHANCEMENTS:

* Filesystem functions are now checked for consistent results to catch invalid data during apply ([#37001](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37001))

* Allow successful init when provider constraint matches at least one valid version ([#37137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37137))

* Performance fix for evaluating high cardinality resources ([#37154](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37154))

*  TF Test: Allow parallel execution of teardown operations ([#37169](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37169))

* `terraform test`: Test authors can now specify definitions for external variables that are referenced within test files directly within the test file itself. ([#37195](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37195))

* `terraform test`: File-level variable blocks can now reference run outputs and other variables." ([#37205](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37205))

* skip redundant comparisons when comparing planned set changes ([#37280](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37280))

* type checking: improve error message on type mismatches. ([#37298](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37298))


BUG FIXES:

* Added a missing warning diagnostic that alerts users when child module contains an ignored `cloud` block. ([#37180](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37180))

* Nested module outputs could lose sensitivity, even when marked as such in the configuration ([#37212](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37212))

* workspace: Updated validation to reject workspaces named "" ([#37267](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37267))

* workspace: Updated the `workspace delete` command to reject `""` as an invalid workspace name ([#37275](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37275))

* plan: truncate invalid or dynamic references in the relevant attributes ([#37290](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37290))

* Test run Parallelism of 1 should not result in deadlock ([#37292](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37292))

* static validation: detect invalid static references via indexes on objects. ([#37298](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37298))

* Fixes resource identity being dropped from state in certain cases ([#37396](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37396))


NOTES:

* The command `terraform rpcapi` is now generally available. It is not intended for public consumption, but exposes certain Terraform operations through an RPC interface compatible with [go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin). ([#37067](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37067))


UPGRADE NOTES:

* `terraform test`: External variables referenced within test files should now be accompanied by a `variable` definition block within the test file. This is optional, but users with complex external variables may see error diagnostics without the additional variable definition. ([#37195](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/37195))
