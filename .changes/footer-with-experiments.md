EXPERIMENTS:

Experiments are only enabled in alpha releases of Terraform CLI. The following features are not yet available in stable releases.

- The experimental "deferred actions" feature, enabled by passing the `-allow-deferral` option to `terraform plan`, permits `count` and `for_each` arguments in `module`, `resource`, and `data` blocks to have unknown values and allows providers to react more flexibly to unknown values.
