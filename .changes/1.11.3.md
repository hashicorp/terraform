## 1.11.3 (March 26, 2025)


BUG FIXES:

* Fixes unintended exit of CLI when using the remote backend and applying with post-plan tasks configured in HCP Terraform ([#36686](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/36686))

* Modules with zero instances that contain ephemeral resources could produce an error during apply ([#36719](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/36719))
