# aws\_autoscaling\_group

Provides an AutoScaling Group resource.

## Example Usage

```
resource "aws_placement_group" "test" {
  name = "test"
  strategy = "cluster"
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "bar" {
  availability_zones = ["us-east-1a"]
  name = "foobar3-terraform-test"
  max_size = 5
  min_size = 2
  health_check_grace_period = 300
  health_check_type = "ELB"
  desired_capacity = 4
  force_delete = true
  placement_group = "${aws_placement_group.test.id}"
  launch_configuration = "${aws_launch_configuration.foobar.name}"

  tag {
    key = "foo"
    value = "bar"
    propagate_at_launch = true
  }
  tag {
    key = "lorem"
    value = "ipsum"
    propagate_at_launch = false
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the auto scale group. By default generated by terraform.
* `max_size` - (Required) The maximum size of the auto scale group.
* `min_size` - (Required) The minimum size of the auto scale group.
    (See also [Waiting for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)
* `availability_zones` - (Optional) A list of AZs to launch resources in.
   Required only if you do not specify any `vpc_zone_identifier`
* `launch_configuration` - (Required) The name of the launch configuration to use.
* `health_check_grace_period` - (Optional) Time after instance comes into service before checking health.
* `health_check_type` - (Optional) "EC2" or "ELB". Controls how health checking is done.
* `desired_capacity` - (Optional) The number of Amazon EC2 instances that
    should be running in the group. (See also [Waiting for
    Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)
* `force_delete` - (Optional) Allows deleting the autoscaling group without waiting
   for all instances in the pool to terminate.  You can force an autoscaling group to delete
   even if it's in the process of scaling a resource. Normally, Terraform
   drains all the instances before deleting the group.  This bypasses that
   behavior and potentially leaves resources dangling.
* `load_balancers` (Optional) A list of load balancer names to add to the autoscaling
   group names.
* `vpc_zone_identifier` (Optional) A list of subnet IDs to launch resources in.
* `termination_policies` (Optional) A list of policies to decide how the instances in the auto scale group should be terminated.
* `tag` (Optional) A list of tag blocks. Tags documented below.
* `placement_group` (Optional) The name of the placement group into which you'll launch your instances, if any.
* `wait_for_capacity_timeout` (Default: "10m") A maximum
  [duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) that Terraform should
  wait for ASG instances to be healthy before timing out.  (See also [Waiting
  for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.) Setting this to "0" causes
  Terraform to skip all Capacity Waiting behavior.
* `wait_for_elb_capacity` - (Optional) Setting this will cause Terraform to wait
  for this number of healthy instances all attached load balancers.
  (See also [Waiting for Capacity](#waiting-for-capacity) below.)

Tags support the following:

* `key` - (Required) Key
* `value` - (Required) Value
* `propagate_at_launch` - (Required) Enables propagation of the tag to
   Amazon EC2 instances launched via this ASG

The following fields are deprecated:

* `min_elb_capacity` - Please use `wait_for_elb_capacity` instead.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The autoscaling group name.
* `availability_zones` - The availability zones of the autoscale group.
* `min_size` - The minimum size of the autoscale group
* `max_size` - The maximum size of the autoscale group
* `default_cooldown` - Time between a scaling activity and the succeeding scaling activity.
* `name` - The name of the autoscale group
* `health_check_grace_period` - Time after instance comes into service before checking health.
* `health_check_type` - "EC2" or "ELB". Controls how health checking is done.
* `desired_capacity` -The number of Amazon EC2 instances that should be running in the group.
* `launch_configuration` - The launch configuration of the autoscale group
* `vpc_zone_identifier` - The VPC zone identifier
* `load_balancers` (Optional) The load balancer names associated with the
   autoscaling group.

~> **NOTE:** When using `ELB` as the health_check_type, `health_check_grace_period` is required.

## Waiting for Capacity

A newly-created ASG is initially empty and begins to scale to `min_size` (or
`desired_capacity`, if specified) by launching instances using the provided
Launch Configuration. These instances take time to launch and boot.

Terraform provides two mechanisms to help consistently manage ASG scale up
time across dependent resources.

#### Waiting for ASG Capacity

The first is default behavior. Terraform waits after ASG creation for
`min_size` (or `desired_capacity`, if specified) healthy instances to show up
in the ASG before continuing.

If `min_size` or `desired_capacity` are changed in a subsequent update,
Terraform will also wait for the correct number of healthy instances before
continuing.

Terraform considers an instance "healthy" when the ASG reports `HealthStatus:
"Healthy"` and `LifecycleState: "InService"`. See the [AWS AutoScaling
Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AutoScalingGroupLifecycle.html)
for more information on an ASG's lifecycle.

Terraform will wait for healthy instances for up to
`wait_for_capacity_timeout`. If ASG creation is taking more than a few minutes,
it's worth investigating for scaling activity errors, which can be caused by
problems with the selected Launch Configuration.

Setting `wait_for_capacity_timeout` to `"0"` disables ASG Capacity waiting.

#### Waiting for ELB Capacity

The second mechanism is optional, and affects ASGs with attached Load
Balancers. If `wait_for_elb_capacity` is set, Terraform will wait for that
number of Instances to be `"InService"` in all attached `load_balancers`. This
can be used to ensure that service is being provided before Terraform moves on.

As with ASG Capacity, Terraform will wait for up to `wait_for_capacity_timeout`
(for `"InService"` instances. If ASG creation takes more than a few minutes,
this could indicate one of a number of configuration problems. See the [AWS
Docs on Load Balancer
Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-troubleshooting.html)
for more information.
