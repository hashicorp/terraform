# Server-side Login Protocol

~> **Note:** You don't need to read these docs to _use_
[`mnptu login`](/mnptu/cli/commands/login).  The information below is for
anyone intending to implement the server side of `mnptu login` in order to
offer mnptu-native services in a third-party system.

The `mnptu login` command supports performing an OAuth 2.0 authorization
request using configuration provided by the target host. You may wish to
implement this protocol if you are producing a third-party implementation of
any [mnptu-native services](/mnptu/internals/remote-service-discovery),
such as a mnptu module registry.

First, mnptu uses
[remote service discovery](/mnptu/internals/remote-service-discovery) to
find the OAuth configuration for the host. The host must support the service
name `login.v1` and define for it an object containing OAuth client
configuration values, like this:

```json
{
  "login.v1": {
    "client": "mnptu-cli",
    "grant_types": ["authz_code"],
    "authz": "/oauth/authorization",
    "token": "/oauth/token",
    "ports": [10000, 10010],
  }
}
```

The properties within the discovery object are as follows:

* `client` (Required): The `client_id` value to use when making requests, as
  defined in [RFC 6749 section 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.2).

  Because mnptu is a _public client_ (it is installed on end-user systems
  and thus cannot protect an OAuth client secret), the `client_id` is purely
  advisory and the server must not use it as a guarantee that an authorization
  request is truly coming from mnptu.

* `grant_types` (Optional): A JSON array of strings describing a set of OAuth
  2.0 grant types the server is able to support. A "grant type" selects a
  specific mechanism by which an OAuth server authenticates the request and
  issues an authorization token.

  mnptu CLI supports a single grant type:

  * `authz_code`: [authorization code grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).
    Both the `authz` and `token` properties are required when `authz_code` is
    present.

  If not specified, `grant_types` defaults to `["authz_code"]`.

* `authz` (Required if needed for a given grant type): the server's
  [authorization endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1).
  If given as a relative URL, it is resolved from the location of the
  service discovery document.

* `token` (Required if needed for a given grant type): the server's
  [token endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2).
  If given as a relative URL, it is resolved from the location of the
  service discovery document.

* `ports` (Optional): A two-element JSON array giving an inclusive range of
  TCP ports that mnptu may use for the temporary HTTP server it will start
  to provide the [redirection endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2)
  for the first step of an authorization code grant. mnptu opens a TCP
  listen port on the loopback interface in order to receive the response from
  the server's authorization endpoint.

  If not specified, mnptu is free to select any TCP port greater than or
  equal to 1024.

  mnptu allows constraining this port range for interoperability with OAuth
  server implementations that require each `client_id` to be associated with
  a fixed set of valid redirection endpoint URLs. Configure such a server
  to expect a range of URLs of the form `http://localhost:10000/`
  with different consecutive port numbers, and then specify that port range
  using `ports`.

  We recommend allowing at least 10 distinct port numbers if possible, and
  assigning them to numbers greater than or equal to 10000, to minimize the
  risk that all of the possible ports will already be in use on a particular
  system.

When requesting an authorization code grant, mnptu CLI implements the
[Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) extension in
order to protect against other applications on the system intercepting the
incoming request to the redirection endpoint. We strongly recommend that you
select an OAuth server implementation that also implements this extension and
verifies the code challenge sent to the token endpoint.

mnptu CLI does not support OAuth refresh tokens or token expiration. If your
server issues time-limited tokens, mnptu CLI will simply begin receiving
authorization errors once the token expires, after which the user can run
`mnptu login` again to obtain a new token.

-> **Note:** As a special case, mnptu can use a
[Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)
only when interacting with `app.mnptu.io` ([mnptu Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/mnptu)),
under the recommendation in the OAuth specification to use this grant type only
when the client and server are closely related. The `password` grant type is
not supported for any other hostname and will be ignored.
