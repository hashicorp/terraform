# `check` block

Use the `check` block to validate your infrastructure outside of the typical resource lifecycle.

The `check` block executes as the last step of plan or apply operation, after Terraform has planned or provisioned your infrastructure. When a `check` block's assertion fails, Terraform reports a warning and continues executing the current operation.

## Background

Terraform evaluates `check` blocks locally whenever you plan or apply your configuration. In HCP Terraform, you can enable health checks on a workspace to automatically and continuously execute checks defined in that workspace's configuration. Refer to [Continuous validation](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health#continuous-validation) for details.

The `check` block is one of Terraform's validation rules for verifying your configuration. Other validation rules run during other stages of a Terraform operation, and can block operations if they fail. The `check` block is the only validation rule that does not block operations if it fails, instead Terraform reports a warning and continues executing the current operation. For information on other validation rules, refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions).

<!-- TODO: Fix link once have Validate your configuration page -->

## Configuration model

The `check` block supports the following arguments:

- [`check "<LABEL>"`](#check) &nbsp; block
 - [`assert`](#assert) &nbsp; block (required)
   - [`condition`](#assert) &nbsp; expression
   - [`error_message`](#assert) &nbsp; string
 - [`data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#data) &nbsp; block
   - [`PROVIDER_ARGUMENTS`](#provider_arguments) &nbsp; block | refer to your provider documentation
   - [`depends_on`](#depends_on) &nbsp; list of references
   - [`provider`](#provider) &nbsp; reference

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `check` block. There are no mutually exclusive arguments for a `check` block.

```hcl
check "<LABEL>" {
 data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
   <DATA_CONFIGURATION>
 }

 assert {
   condition     = <EXPRESSION>
   error_message = "<error message string>"
 }
}
```

A `check` block can contain [multiple assertions](#multiple-assertions).

## Specification

A `check` block supports the following configuration.

### `check "<LABEL>"`

While declaring a `check` block, you must add a unique label that starts with a letter or underscore and contains only letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.

You can define the following blocks on a `check` block. A `check` block's assertion(s) are the conditions the check verifies.

| Argument | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `assert` | The validation condition to evaluate. A check block contains one or more assertions. | Block | Required |
| `data` | One nested data source to use for validation. You can only reference this data source within its enclosing `check` block. | Block | Optional |

### `assert`

A `check` block must contain at least one `assert` block. Each `assert` block specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates after plan and apply operations.

```hcl
check "unique_name" {
 assert {
   condition     = <expression-to-verify>
   error_message = "The error message Terraform displays if the assert expression is false."
 }
}
```

For a check to pass, each `assert` block's `condition` must evaluate to `true`. The `condition` arguments within an `assert` block can reference nested data sources within the enclosing `check` block and any variables, resources, data sources, or module outputs within the current module.

The `assert` block supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | Expression that Terraform evaluates. If the expression evaluates to `true`, then the `assert` block passes. | Expression | Required |
| `error_message` | Message to display if the condition evaluates to `false`. | String | Required |

Refer to the [examples](#examples) to learn more about defining assertions within a `check` block.

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.
- Required: Yes, each `check` block must contain at least one `assert` block.
- Example: [Declare multiple assertions](#multiple-assetions).

### `data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`

You can optionally declare a `data` block within a `check` block to create a nested data source that lets you fetch information to reference in your conditions.

```hcl
check "unique_name" {
 data "TYPE" "<LABEL>" {
   <provider_specific_arguments>
 }

 assert { #... }
}
```

You can only reference a nested data source within its enclosing `check` block. If a nested data source's provider raises errors, they are masked as warnings and do not prevent the Terraform operation from continuing.

Unlike other [data sources](/terraform/language/data-sources), Terraform fetches the information for nested data sources as the final step of a plan or apply operation. You can use nested data sources to fetch information about your infrastructure after Terraform has applied the rest of your configuration. For example, you can use a nested `data` block to ping your website's API to ensure Terraform successfully applied and built your website's infrastructure.

A nested `data` block requires a type and a label:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the type of data source to use.
- `LABEL`: A unique name for this data source. Refer to [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) for label recommendations.

The arguments within a `data` block are provider-specific. Refer to the [registry documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/) for your specified provider for details.

### `depends_on`

You can use the `depends_on` meta-argument if a nested data source depends on another resource to fetch information.

```hcl
check "unique_name" {
 data "aws_ami" "web" {
   <provider_specific_arguments>
   depends_on = [<another_resource.name>]
 }

 assert { #... }
}
```

We recommend adding the `depends_on` meta-argument if your nested data source depends on another resource without referencing that resource directly.

For example, if you define a `check` that verifies that a website API returns `200`, that check will fail the first time Terraform runs your configuration because your website's infrastructure will not exist yet. You can set the `depends_on` argument to a resource such as the load balancer to ensure Terraform only runs the `check` once the website is up. When running an operation, Terraform evaluates the `check`, warns `known after apply` until that crucial piece of your website is ready, and continues the operation.

However, this strategy only works if your nested data source does not directly reference the resource it `depends_on`. Otherwise, anytime that resource changes, the `check` block warns `known after apply` until Terraform updates that resource, making your check potentially noisy and ineffective. Refer to the [example](#resource-dependency) for more details.

The `depends_on` block is a meta-argument. Meta-arguments are built-in arguments that control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for additional information.

<!-- TODO: Update meta-arguments concept link once we have the page -->

### `provider`

The `provider` argument instructs Terraform to use an alternate provider configuration to provision the nested data source.

```hcl
check "unique_name" {
 data "aws_ami" "web" {
   <provider_specific_arguments>
   provider = <provider>.<alias>
 }

 assert { #... }
}
```

By default, Terraform automatically selects a provider based on the nested data source's type, but you can create multiple provider configurations and use a non-default configuration for specific data sources.

The `provider` argument is a meta-argument, which is built into Terraform and controls the way that Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider) for additional information.

<!-- TODO: Update meta-arguments concept link once we have the page -->

#### Summary

- Data type: Block.
- Default: None.
- Supported meta-arguments: `depends_on` and `provider`.
- Example: [Resource dependency](#resource-dependency).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `check` blocks.

### Validate endpoint health

The following example validates that an endpoint returns a healthy status code:

```hcl
check "health_check" {
 data "http" "endpoint" {
   url = "https://api.example.com/health"
 }

 assert {
   condition     = data.http.endpoint.status_code == 200
   error_message = "Health check failed: ${data.http.endpoint.url} returned ${data.http.endpoint.status_code}"
 }
}
```

This check uses a nested data source to check an endpoint's status code. If the endpoint returns a `200` then the check passes.

### Multiple assertions

This example shows how to construct a check that uses multiple assertions:

```hcl
check "service_validation" {
 data "aws_lb" "app" {
   name = "application-lb"
 }

 assert {
   condition     = data.aws_lb.app.enable_deletion_protection
   error_message = "Load balancer must have deletion protection enabled"
 }

 assert {
   condition     = length(data.aws_lb.app.security_groups) > 0
   error_message = "Load balancer must have at least one security group"
 }
}
```

The check passes if the load balancer has at least one security group attached and has deletion protection enabled.

### Resource dependency

This example shows how to use `depends_on` to ensure the check only runs after a resource is available:

```hcl
check "database_connection" {
 data "postgresql_database" "app_db" {
   name       = "application"
   depends_on = [aws_db_instance.main]
 }

 assert {
   condition     = data.postgresql_database.app_db.allow_connections
   error_message = "Database is not accepting connections"
 }
}
```

The check warns `known after apply` during operations until Terraform creates the `aws_db_instance.main` database, meaning the check won't throw false warnings until Terraform creates that resource.
