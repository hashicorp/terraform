# Variables and Outputs

The Terraform language includes a few kinds of blocks for requesting or
publishing named values.

- [Input Variables](/docs/language/values/variables.html) serve as parameters for
  a Terraform module, so users can customize behavior without editing the source.

- [Output Values](/docs/language/values/outputs.html) are like return values for a
  Terraform module.

- [Local Values](/docs/language/values/locals.html) are a convenience feature for
  assigning a short name to an expression.
