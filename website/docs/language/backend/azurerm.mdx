description: Terraform can store state remotely in Azure Blob Storage.
---

# azurerm

Stores the state as a Blob with the given Key within the Blob Container within [the Blob Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

This backend supports state locking and consistency checking with Azure Blob Storage native capabilities.

~> Terraform 1.1 and 1.2 supported a feature-flag to allow enabling/disabling the use of Microsoft Graph (and MSAL) rather than Azure Active Directory Graph (and ADAL) - however this flag has since been removed in Terraform 1.3. Microsoft Graph (and MSAL) are now enabled by default and Azure Active Directory Graph (and ADAL) can no longer be used.

## Authentication

The `azurerm` backend supports 3 methods of authenticating to the storage account:

- Access Key (default)
- Azure Active Directory
- SAS Token

The *Access Key* method can be used directly, by specifying the access key, or in combination with an Azure AD principal (e.g. user, service principal or managed identity). To use an Access Key directly you must generate one for your state file blob and specify it in the backend configuration. If neither an access key or client ID is specified, Terraform will attempt to use Azure CLI. In both cases where no access key is given, Terraform will attempt to retrieve the access key for the storage account, using the authenticated Azure AD principal.

The *Azure Active Directory* method can only be used in combination with an Azure AD principal. To use the Azure Active Directory method you must set the `use_azuread_auth` variable to `true` in your backend configuration. This will cause the backend to use the Access Token of the Azure AD principal to authenticate to the state file blob, instead of authenticating using a shared access key.

The *SAS Token* method can only be used directly. You must generate a SAS Token for your state file blob and pass it to the backend config.

The `azurerm` backend supports the following authentication scenarios to connect to the storage account, based on the configuration variables provided:

| Authentication Method | Storage Account Authentication Type | Minimum Required Configuration† |
|-----|---|---|
| User Principal via Azure CLI | Access Key | N/A |
| User Principal via Azure CLI | Azure AD | `use_azuread_auth = true` |
| Service Principal or User Assigned Managed Identity via OIDC (Workload identity federation) | Access Key | `use_oidc = true` |
| Service Principal or User Assigned Managed Identity via OIDC (Workload identity federation) | Azure AD | `use_azuread_auth = true`, `use_oidc = true` |
| Managed Identity Principal | Access Key | `use_msi = true` |
| Managed Identity Principal | Azure AD | `use_azuread_auth = true`, `use_msi = true` |
| Service Principal via Client Secret | Access Key | `client_secret = "..."` |
| Service Principal via Client Secret | Azure AD | `use_azuread_auth = true`, `client_secret = "..."` |
| Service Principal via Client Certificate | Access Key | `client_certificate_path = "..."` |
| Service Principal via Client Certificate | Azure AD | `client_certificate_path = "...`, `use_azuread_auth = true` |
| Access Key direct | Access Key | `access_key = "..."` |
| SAS Token direct | SAS Token | `sas_token = "..."` |

† There are sometimes more options needed for successful authentication. The variable shown is the one that triggers the backend to use a given authentication scenario. You can see examples of each option below.

-> Sensitive values should not be hardcoded into your configuration, and should instead be specified using environment variables or partial configuration flags in the `init` command of Terraform CLI.

## Example Backend Configurations

### Backend: Azure AD User via Azure CLI

This method is not suitable for automation since it only supports a User Principal. To check which tenant and subscription you are pointed to, run `az account show`.

*Connect to Storage Account with Access Key*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"  # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"resource_group_name=<resource group name>"` in the `init` command.
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"                      # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"storage_account_name=<storage account name>"` in the `init` command.
    container_name       = "tfstate"                       # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"container_name=<container name>"` in the `init` command.
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"        # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"key=<blob key name>"` in the `init` command.
  }
}
```

*Connect to Storage Account with Azure Active Directory authentication*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"  # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"resource_group_name=<resource group name>"` in the `init` command.
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"                      # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"storage_account_name=<storage account name>"` in the `init` command.
    container_name       = "tfstate"                       # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"container_name=<container name>"` in the `init` command.
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"        # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"key=<blob key name>"` in the `init` command.
    use_azuread_auth     = true                            # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_AZUREAD` environment variable.
  }
}
```

### Backend: Azure AD Service Principal or User Assigned Managed Identity via OIDC (Workload Identity Federation)

You can use an App Registration (Service Principal) or a User Assigned Managed Identity to configure federated credentials. You must supply the Client ID of the principal.

*Connect to Storage Account with Access Key*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"          # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"resource_group_name=<resource group name>"` in the `init` command.
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"                              # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"storage_account_name=<storage account name>"` in the `init` command.
    container_name       = "tfstate"                               # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"container_name=<container name>"` in the `init` command.
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"                # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"key=<blob key name>"` in the `init` command.
    use_oidc             = true                                    # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_OIDC` environment variable.
    client_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
    subscription_id      = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable.
    tenant_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
  }
}
```

*Connect to Storage Account with Azure Active Directory authentication*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"          # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"resource_group_name=<resource group name>"` in the `init` command.
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"                              # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"storage_account_name=<storage account name>"` in the `init` command.
    container_name       = "tfstate"                               # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"container_name=<container name>"` in the `init` command.
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"                # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"key=<blob key name>"` in the `init` command.
    use_oidc             = true                                    # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_OIDC` environment variable.
    client_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
    subscription_id      = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable.
    tenant_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
    use_azuread_auth     = true                                    # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_AZUREAD` environment variable.
  }
}
```

### Backend: Azure AD Managed Identity Principal

You can use a User Assigned Managed Identity as well as a System Assigned Managed Identity on your agent / runner compute environment. However the backend does not currently support specifying the Client ID of the User Assigned Managed Identity, so you can only supply one per compute instance.

*Connect to Storage Account with Access Key*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"          # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"resource_group_name=<resource group name>"` in the `init` command.
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"                              # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"storage_account_name=<storage account name>"` in the `init` command.
    container_name       = "tfstate"                               # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"container_name=<container name>"` in the `init` command.
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"                # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"key=<blob key name>"` in the `init` command.
    use_msi              = true                                    # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_MSI` environment variable.
    client_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
    subscription_id      = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable.
    tenant_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
  }
}
```

*Connect to Storage Account with Azure Active Directory authentication*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"          # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"resource_group_name=<resource group name>"` in the `init` command.
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"                              # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"storage_account_name=<storage account name>"` in the `init` command.

    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"                # Can be passed via `-backend-config=`"key=<blob key name>"` in the `init` command.
    use_msi              = true                                    # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_MSI` environment variable.

    tenant_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Can also be set via `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
    use_azuread_auth     = true                                    # Can also be set via `ARM_USE_AZUREAD` environment variable.
  }
}
```

### Backend: Azure AD Service Principal via Client Secret

~> **Warning!** This method requires you to manage and rotate a secret. Consider using OIDC as a more secure approach.

*Connect to Storage Account with Access Key*

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {

## Example Data Source Configurations

### Data Source: Azure AD User Principal via Azure CLI

This method is not suitable for automation since it only supports a User Principal. To check which tenant and subscription you are pointed to, run `az account show`.

*Connect to Storage Account with Access Key*

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"
    storage_account_name = "terraform123abc"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

*Connect to Storage Account with Azure Active Directory authentication*

  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    resource_group_name  = "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"
