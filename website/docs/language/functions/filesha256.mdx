# `filesha256` function reference

This topic provides reference information about the `filesha256` function, which calculates the SHA-256 hash of a file's contents. 

## Introduction

The `filesha256` is a variant of [`sha256`](/terraform/language/functions/sha256)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

Use the `filesha1` function instead of wrapping the `file` function in a `sha1` function, for example `sha1(file(filename))`, because [`file`](/terraform/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text. As a result, you cannot use `sha1(file(filename))` to create hashes for binary files.

## Syntax

Use the `filesha256` function with the following syntax:

```hcl
filesha256(path)
```

The `path` is the relative or absolute file path to the file whose SHA-256 hash you want to compute.

In the following example, the function returns the SHA-256 value of `example.txt`.

```hcl
$ filesha512("example.txt")
a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda32b0b571d0f6a26f2bb
```

## Example use case

In the following example, the `filesha256` function computes the SHA-256 hash of the file `example.txt` located in the current module's directory.

```hcl
output "file_hash" {
  value = filesha256("example.txt")
}
```
