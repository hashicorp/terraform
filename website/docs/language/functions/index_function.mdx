# `index` Function

`index` finds the first element index for a given value in a list.

```hcl
index(list, value)
```

The returned index is zero-based. This function produces an error if the given
value is not present in the list.

## Examples

```
> index(["a", "b", "c"], "b")
1
```

In this example, the index of the first occurence of `"two"` is returned.

```
> index(["one", "two", "two"], "two")
1
```
