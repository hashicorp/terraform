# `sha256` Function

`sha256` computes the SHA256 hash of a given string and encodes it with
hexadecimal digits.

The given string is first encoded as UTF-8 and then the SHA256 algorithm is applied
as defined in [RFC 4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634). The raw hash is
then encoded to lowercase hexadecimal digits before returning.

## Examples

```
> sha256("hello world")
b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
```

* [`filesha256`](/terraform/language/functions/filesha256) calculates the same hash from
  the contents of a file rather than from a string value.
* [`base64sha256`](/terraform/language/functions/base64sha256) calculates the same hash but returns
  the result in a more-compact Base64 encoding.
