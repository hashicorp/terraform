# `base64sha256` Function

`base64sha256` computes the SHA256 hash of a given string and encodes it with
Base64. This is not equivalent to `base64encode(sha256("test"))` since `sha256()`
returns hexadecimal representation.

The given string is first encoded as UTF-8 and then the SHA256 algorithm is applied
as defined in [RFC 4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634). The raw hash is
then encoded with Base64 before returning. Terraform uses the "standard" Base64
alphabet as defined in [RFC 4648 section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4).

## Examples

```
> base64sha256("hello world")

```

## Related Functions

* [`filebase64sha256`](/terraform/language/functions/filebase64sha256) calculates the same hash from
  the contents of a file rather than from a string value.
* [`sha256`](/terraform/language/functions/sha256) calculates the same hash but returns the result
  in a more-verbose hexadecimal encoding.
