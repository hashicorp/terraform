# `indent` function reference

This topic provides reference information about the `indent` function.
You can use the `indent` function to add indentation to the beginning of each line, except the first, in a multi-line string.

## Introduction

The `indent` function adds a specified number of spaces to the beginning of each line in a multi-line string, except for the first line.
You can use the `indent` function to help ensure that complex strings are properly formatted, consistent, and readable.
The function can be especially useful when you work with YAML, JSON, Kubernetes, or other formats that require complex, structured text.

## Syntax

Use the `indent` function with the following syntax:

```hcl
indent(num_spaces, string)
```

- The first argument is numeric. It specifies the number of spaces you want to add to each line except the first.
- The second argument is a string. It specifies the multi-line string to which you want to add spaces.

In the following example, the `indent` function adds two spaces to the beginning of each line of the `description` variable to make it easier to read:

```hcl
output "formatted_description" {
  value = indent(2, var.description)
}
```
