# `directoryset` Function

The directoryset function enumerates a set of directory names given a pattern.
The path is automatically removed from the resulting set of directory names and
any result still containing path separators always returns forward slash (`/`)
as the path separator for cross-system compatibility.

```hcl
directoryset(path, pattern)
```

Supported pattern matches:

- `*` - matches any sequence of non-separator characters
- `**` - matches any sequence of characters, including separator characters
- `?` - matches any single non-separator character
- `{alternative1,...}` - matches a sequence of characters if one of the comma-separated alternatives matches
- `[CLASS]` - matches any single non-separator character inside a class of characters (see below)
- `[^CLASS]` - matches any single non-separator character outside a class of characters (see below)

Note that the doublestar (`**`) must appear as a path component by itself. A
pattern such as /path\*\* is invalid and will be treated the same as /path\*, but
/path\*/\*\* should achieve the desired result.

Character classes support the following:

- `[abc]` - matches any single character within the set
- `[a-z]` - matches any single character within the range

Functions are evaluated during configuration parsing rather than at apply time,
so this function can only be used with directories that are already present on
disk before Terraform takes any actions.

## Examples

```
> directoryset(path.module, "*") # Get all directories
toset([
  ".git",
  ".github",
  ".release",
  "docs",
  "internal",
  "scripts",
  "testing",
  "tools",
  "version",
  "website",
])

> directoryset(path.module, ".git*") # Get only directories starting with ".git"
toset([
  ".git",
  ".github",
])

> directoryset(path.module, "[^.]*") # Filter out dotfiles
toset([
  "docs",
  "internal",
  "scripts",
  "testing",
  "tools",
  "version",
  "website",
])

> directoryset("${path.module}/.github", "actions/**") # Start from a different base, and get everything under the "actions" directory
toset([
  "actions/equivalence-test",
  "actions/go-version",
])
```
