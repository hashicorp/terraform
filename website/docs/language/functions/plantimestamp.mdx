# `plantimestamp` Function

-> **Note:** This function is only available in Terraform v1.5 and later.

`plantimestamp` returns a UTC timestamp string in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.

In the Terraform language, timestamps are conventionally represented as
strings using [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
"Date and Time format" syntax, and so `plantimestamp` returns a string
in this format.

The result of this function will change for every plan operation. It is intended
for use within [Custom Conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions)
as a way to validate time sensitive resources such as TLS certificates.

There are circumstances, such as during a Terraform [Refresh-only](/terraform/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes) plan, where
the value for this function will be recomputed but not propagated to resources
defined within the configuration. As such, it is recommended that this function
only be used to compare against timestamps exported by providers and not against
timestamps generated in the configuration.

The `plantimestamp` function is not available within the Terraform console.

## Examples

```
> plantimestamp()
2018-05-13T07:44:12Z
```

```terraform
check "terraform_io_certificate" {
  data "tls_certificate" "terraform_io" {
    url = "https://www.terraform.io/"
  }

  assert {
    condition = timecmp(plantimestamp(), data.tls_certificate.terraform_io.certificates[0].not_after) < 0
    error_message = "terraform.io certificate has expired"
  }
}
```
