# `md5` Function

`md5` computes the MD5 hash of a given string and encodes it with
hexadecimal digits.

The given string is first encoded as UTF-8 and then the MD5 algorithm is applied
as defined in [RFC 1321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321). The raw hash is
then encoded to lowercase hexadecimal digits before returning.

Collision attacks have been successfully performed against this hashing
function. Before using this function for anything security-sensitive, refer to
[RFC 6151](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151) for updated security
considerations applying to the MD5 algorithm.

## Examples

```
> md5("hello world")

```

* [`filemd5`](/terraform/language/functions/filemd5) calculates the same hash from
  the contents of a file rather than from a string value.
