# `list` Function

The `list` function is no longer available. Prior to Terraform v0.12 it was
the only available syntax for writing a literal list inside an expression,
but Terraform v0.12 introduced a new first-class syntax.

To update an expression like `list(a, b, c)`, write the following instead:

```hcl
tolist([a, b, c])
```

The `[ ... ]` brackets construct a tuple value, and then the `tolist` function
then converts it to a list. For more information on the value types in the
Terraform language, see [Type Constraints](/terraform/language/expressions/types).

* [`concat`](/terraform/language/functions/concat) produces a new list by concatenating together the
  elements from other lists.
* [`tolist`](/terraform/language/functions/tolist) converts a set or tuple value to a list.
