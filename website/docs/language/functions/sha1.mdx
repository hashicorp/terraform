# `sha1` Function

`sha1` computes the SHA1 hash of a given string and encodes it with
hexadecimal digits.

The given string is first encoded as UTF-8 and then the SHA1 algorithm is applied
as defined in [RFC 3174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3174). The raw hash is
then encoded to lowercase hexadecimal digits before returning.

Collision attacks have been successfully performed against this hashing
function. Before using this function for anything security-sensitive, review
relevant literature to understand the security implications.

## Examples

```
> sha1("hello world")

```

* [`filesha1`](/terraform/language/functions/filesha1) calculates the same hash from
  the contents of a file rather than from a string value.
