# `contains` Function

`contains` determines whether the list, tuple, or set given in its first
argument contains at least one element that is equal to the value in the second
argument, using the same definition of equality as the `==` operator described in
[Equality Operators](/terraform/language/expressions/operators#equality-operators).

```hcl
contains(list, value)
```

## Examples

```
> contains(["a", "b", "c"], "a")
true
> contains(["a", "b", "c"], "d")
false
```
