# `directoryexists` Function

`directoryexists` determines whether a directory exists at a given path.

```hcl
directoryexists(path)
```

Functions are evaluated during configuration parsing rather than at apply time,
so this function can only be used with files that are already present on disk
before Terraform takes any actions.

This function works only with directories. If used with a FIFO,
or other special mode, it will return an error.

## Examples

```
> directoryexists("${path.module}")
true

> directoryexists("${path.module}/someboguspath")
false
```
