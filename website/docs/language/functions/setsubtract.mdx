# `setsubtract` Function

The `setsubtract` function returns a new set containing the elements from the first set that are not present in the second set. In other words, it computes the
[relative complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_\(set_theory\)#Relative_complement) of the second set.

```hcl
setsubtract(a, b)
```

## Examples

```
> setsubtract(["a", "b", "c"], ["a", "c"])
toset([
  "b",
])
```

### Set Difference (Symmetric Difference)

```
> setunion(setsubtract(["a", "b", "c"], ["a", "c", "d"]), setsubtract(["a", "c", "d"], ["a", "b", "c"]))
toset([
  "b",
  "d",
])
```
