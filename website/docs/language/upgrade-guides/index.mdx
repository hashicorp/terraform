# Upgrading to Terraform v1.11

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.11 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.11 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises).
There are minor changes that may require additional upgrade steps:

- Attempting to override a variable during apply via TF_VAR_ environment variable will now yield warning instead of misleading error.

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.11/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## Terraform Test

- The `-junit-xml` option for the terraform test command is now generally available. This option allows the command to create a test report in JUnit XML format. Feedback during the experimental phase helped map terraform test concepts to the JUnit XML format, and new additons may happen in future releases.
- Test runs now support using mocked or overridden values in unit tests (i.e., with command = "plan"). Set override_during = plan in the run block to use the overridden values during the plan phase. The default value is `override_during = apply`.
- Run blocks now support a `state_key` attribute, allowing test authors control over which internal state file should be used for the current test run. 

## S3 Native State Locking

S3 native state locking is now generally available. The use_lockfile argument enables users to adopt the S3-native mechanism for state locking. As part of this change, we've deprecated the DynamoDB-related arguments in favor of this new locking mechanism. While you can still use DynamoDB alongside S3-native state locking for migration purposes, we encourage migrating to the new state locking mechanism.

To opt-in to S3 native state locking, set `use_lockfile` to `true`.

```terraform
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # additional configuration omitted for brevity
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}
```

With S3 locking enabled, a lock file will be placed in the same location as the state file.
The lock file will be named identically to the state file, but with a `.tflock` extension.
**S3 bucket policies and IAM policies attached to the calling principal may need to be adjusted to include permissions for the new lock file.**
