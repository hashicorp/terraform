# Upgrading to Terraform v1.8

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.8 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.8 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a
small number of users. Specifically, the following updates may require
additional upgrade steps:
* [`use_legacy_workflow` is no longer available for the S3 backend](#s3-backend-authentication-changes)
* [Possible spurious changes when refreshing](#possible-spurious-changes-when-refreshing)
* [Ending support for macOS 10.15 Catalina](#ending-support-for-macos-1015-catalina)
* [Minor change to `jsonencode` function results](#minor-change-to-jsonencode-function-results)

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.8/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## S3 Backend authentication changes

Terraform v1.7 began the deprecation of a legacy approach to authentication,
making the `use_legacy_workflow` argument default to `false` and thus making the
old authentication workflow opt-in.

Terraform v1.8 completes this deprecation process by removing the
`use_legacy_workflow` argument. The old behavior is no longer available, and
so you will need to adopt the new behavior when upgrading to Terraform v1.8.

The new implementation follows the authentication process implemented in the
official AWS SDK for Go, which is therefore more consistent with other AWS
tools such as the official AWS CLI.

## Possible spurious changes when refreshing

If you use the `-refresh-only` or `-refresh=false` planning options for your
first plan after upgrading, Terraform might show resource instance diffs without
any visible changes. This does not affect plans created with both of those
options disabled.

Previous versions of Terraform used a mixture of both dynamic and static
tracking of sensitive values in resource instance attributes. That meant that,
for example, correctly honoring sensitive valeus when interpreting the
`terraform show -json` output required considering both the dynamic sensitivity
information directly in the output _and_ static sensitivity information in the
provider schema.

To simplify handling of sensitivity in these cases, Terraform now copies the
schema-based sensitivity information into the state along with the dynamic
information. Terraform must therefore perform a one-time backfill update
of the state metadata for resource types which have sensitive attributes.

When using the default planning options Terraform should handle this update
quietly, as part of the refresh step performed during planning. However, if
you use the `-refresh-only` or `-refresh=false` option then you will effectively
disable one half of this process, causing the UI to report spurious changes
that affect only the metadata in the state.

These no-change metadata updates should not cause any problems, and will be
resolved once a plan has been applied using Terraform v1.8. If you are concerned
about a particular plan then try removing the `-refresh-only` or `-refresh=false`
option, which should then quiet the spurious change.

## Ending support for macOS 10.15 Catalina

Terraform v1.8 is the last series that will support macOS 10.15 Catalina. The
next minor release series will require macOS 11 Big Sur or later.

## Minor change to `jsonencode` function results

In previous versions of Terraform, the `jsonencode` function encoded the
control characters U+0008 (backspace) and U+000C (form feed) in strings using
the unicode escape syntax: `\u0008` and `\u000c` respectively.

Terraform now follows the JSON idiom more closely by using `\b` for backspace
and `\f` for form feed. These shorter encodings are equivalent for a correct
JSON parser, but are more readable for humans due to being mnemonics.

These two control characters are relatively rarely used in practical JSON
and so we don't expect that this change will have significant impact. If you
are using them then this may cause the following effects:

- If you are using `jsonencode` to produce JSON-encoded data for consumption
  by a JSON parser that doesn't correctly support these short encoding forms
  then it may not be able to parse the new results. Terraform implements
  JSON encoding as defined in IETF RFC 7159, which requires that parsers
  support these shorter encodings.

- If you are using `jsonencode` to populate a resource argument where the
  underlying provider does not perform JSON normalization, the provider might
  propose changing the affected object to use the new encoding form. As long
  as the remote system correctly implements JSON, this update should not
  change the meaning of the JSON document.

This change only affects strings that include these two specific control
characters. If you do not use these control characters in the strings you pass
to `jsonencode` then this change will have no effect for you.
