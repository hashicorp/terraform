# Ephemeral resource configuration reference

This topic provides reference information for the `ephemeral` block. 

-> Ephemeral resources are in public beta and available in Terraform v1.10 and later. The workflows of ephemeral resources are subject to change.

## Introduction

Ephemeral resources are Terraform resources that are essentially temporary. Ephemeral resources have
a unique lifecycle and Terraform does not store them in state. Each ephemeral block describes one or more
ephemeral resources, such as a temporary password or connection to another
system.

<!-- After page exists, add: For information about how Terraform manages ephemeral resources, refer to
[Epehemeral Values](/terraform/language/epehemeral-values). -->

## Ephemeral resource syntax

An `ephemeral` block declares an ephemeral resource of a specific type with a
specific local name, much like a `resource` block. Terraform uses an ephemeral resource's name to
refer to that resource in the same module, but an ephemeral resource's name has no meaning
outside that module's scope.

### Ephemeral resource arguments

Most of the arguments within the body of an `ephemeral` block are specific to
the ephemeral resource you are defining. The ephemeral resource type's documentation in the [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) 
lists which arguments are available and how you should format your resource's values.

### Resource types

As with resources and data sources, each provider in the [Terraform
Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) includes documentation
for the ephemeral resources it supports, if any.

### Meta-arguments

The Terraform language defines the following meta-arguments, which you can use
with any ephemeral resource type to change the behavior of those resources. These
meta-arguments work the same way for resources, data sources, and ephemeral
resources:

- [`depends_on`, for specifying hidden dependencies](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on)
- [`count`, for creating multiple resource instances according to a count](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count)
- [`for_each`, to create multiple instances according to a map or set of strings](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each)
- [`provider`, for selecting a non-default provider configuration](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider)
- [`lifecycle`, for lifecycle customizations](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)

Ephemeral resources to not support the `provisioner` meta-argument.

### Referring to ephemeral resources

You can only reference ephemeral resources in specific ephemeral contexts or
Terraform throws an error. The following are valid contexts for referencing
ephemeral resources:

* In another ephemeral resource
* In [local values](/terraform/language/values/locals#ephemeral-values)
* In [ephemeral variables](/terraform/language/values/variables#exclude-values-from-state)
* In [ephemeral outputs](/terraform/language/values/outputs#ephemeral-avoid-storing-values-in-state-or-plan-files)

## Ephemeral resource lifecycle

The lifecycle of ephemeral resources is different from resources and data sources.
When Terraform provisions ephemeral resources, it will take the following steps:

1. If Terraform needs to access an ephemeral resource's result, it opens
that ephemeral resource. For example, if Terraform opens an ephemeral resource for a Vault secret, the Vault provider obtains a lease and returns a secret. 

1. If Terraform needs access to the ephemeral resource for longer than the
remote system's enforced expiration time, Terraform asks the provider
to renew it periodically. For example, if Terraform renews a Vault secret ephemeral
resource, the Vault provider then calls Vault's lease renewal API endpoint
to extend the expiration time.

1. Once Terraform no longer needs an ephemeral resource, Terraform closes
it. This happens once the providers that depend on a certain ephemeral resource
complete all of their work for the current Terraform run phase. For example, closing a
Vault secret ephemeral resource means the Vault provider explicitly ends the
lease, allowing Vault to immediately revoke the associated credentials.

Terraform follows these lifecycle steps for each instance of an ephemeral
resource in a given configuration.

### Dependency graph

Ephemeral resources form nodes in Terraform's dependency graph which interact
similarly to resources and data sources. For example, when a resource or data
source depends on an attribute of an ephemeral resource, Terraform
automatically provisions the ephemeral resource first.

## Configuration model

The following list outlines field hierarchy, language-specific data types, and
requirements in the `ephemeral` block. 

- [`ephemeral`](#ephemeral): map
  - [`attributes`](#ephemeral): string
  - [`meta-arguments`](#ephemeral): string

## Complete configuration

An `ephemeral` block has the following form:

```hcl
ephemeral "<resource_type>" "<resource_name>" {
  <attributes>
  <meta-arguments>
}
```

<!-- random_password ephemeral not available from random provider yet.

## Example

The following example uses the `random` provider to provision an ephemeral
resource representing a password:

```hcl
provider random {}

ephemeral "random_password" "password" {
  length           = 16
  special          = true
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}
```
