# Use write-only fields

A Terraform resource can include a special ephemeral field type called a write-only field, which only allows you to overwrite that field's value. You can use write-only fields to store generated sensitive data for a current Terraform operation, such as a temporary password, without worrying about that value being saved in your state.

-> **Public Beta**: Write-only fields are in public beta and available in Terraform v1.11 and later.  Public beta features and APIs are subject to change.


## Introduction

Write-only fields are ephemeral, meaning they are not written to Terraform's state and are only available during the current Terraform run. On a new Terraform operation, the write-only field always start as `null` before Terraform overwrites it with a new value from your configuration.

Write-only fields are unique among other ephemeral constructs in Terraform because you can assign both ephemeral and non-ephemeral data as the value of a write-only field.
