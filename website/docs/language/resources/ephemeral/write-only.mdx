# Use write-only arguments

Terraform resources can include specifically ephemeral arguments for data that only needs to exist temporarily. An ephemeral argument on a resource is called a **write-only argument**. Write-only arguments can store sensitive data for the current Terraform operation, such as a short-lived password, token, or session identifier.

## Introduction

Write-only arguments are only available during the runtime of a Terraform operation, and Terraform omits them from state and plan files. On a new Terraform operation, a write-only argument starts as `null` before Terraform overwrites it with a new value from your configuration.

Write-only arguments are unique among other ephemeral constructs in Terraform because you can assign both ephemeral and non-ephemeral data as the value of a write-only argument.

## Define a write-only argument

Providers define write-only arguments on specific fields in their resources. For example, the `aws_db_instance` resource type has a write-only `password` argument:

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
 instance_class = "db.t5.micro"
 username       = "admin"

 password_wo = ephemeral.random.password.value
 password_wo_version = 1
}
```

The `password_wo` argument is write-only, and can accept with an ephemeral or non-ephemeral value. 

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
 instance_class = "db.t5.micro"
 username       = "admin"

 password_wo = 5
 password_wo_version = 1
}
```


Add guidance on avoiding accidentally leaking a non-ephemeral value in a write-only argument.

### Versioning ephemeral values

<!-- TODO: Update with provider code samples when we have them

## Provider examples

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}

provider "random" {}

ephemeral "random" "password" {
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
 instance_class = "db.t5.micro"
 username       = "admin"

# 'password' is a write-only argument 
# 'password_wo_version' controls when the password_wo gets updated 
 password_wo = ephemeral.random.password.value
 password_wo_version = 1
}
```
