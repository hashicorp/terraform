# Ephemerality in resources

Configuring infrastructure often requires creating and handling sensitive values, such as temporary passwords or API keys, that you may not want Terraform to store in its state. Terraform provides two tools for resources to manage data you do not want to store in state: the `ephemeral` resource block and ephemeral write-only fields on specific resources.

## Ephemeral resources

Ephemeral resources are Terraform resources that are essentially temporary. Ephemeral resources have a unique lifecycle, and Terraform does not store them in its state. Each `ephemeral` block describes one or more ephemeral resources, such as a temporary password or connection to another system.

In your configuration, you can only reference an `ephemeral` block in [other ephemeral contexts](/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral/reference#reference-ephemeral-resources).

### Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an ephemeral resource is different from resources and data sources. When Terraform provisions ephemeral resources, it performs the following steps:

1. If Terraform needs to access the result of an ephemeral resource, it opens
that ephemeral resource. For example, if Terraform opens an ephemeral resource for a Vault secret, the Vault provider obtains a lease and returns a secret. 

1. If Terraform needs access to the ephemeral resource for longer than the
remote system's enforced expiration time, Terraform asks the provider
to renew it periodically. For example, if Terraform renews a Vault secret ephemeral resource, the Vault provider then calls Vault's lease renewal API endpoint to extend the expiration time.

1. Once Terraform no longer needs an ephemeral resource, Terraform closes
it. This happens after the providers that depend on a certain ephemeral resource
complete all of their work for the current Terraform run phase. For example, closing a Vault secret ephemeral resource means the Vault provider explicitly ends the lease, allowing Vault to immediately revoke the associated credentials.

Terraform follows these lifecycle steps for each instance of an ephemeral
resource in a given configuration.

### Configuration model

To learn more about the `ephemeral` block, refer to the [Ephemeral resource reference](/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral/reference).

## Write-only fields

-> **Public Beta**: Write-only fields are in public beta and available in Terraform v1.11 and later.  Public beta features and APIs are subject to change.

A Terraform resource can include a special ephemeral field type that only allows you to overwrite its value. Write-only fields can help store generated sensitive data for a current Terraform operation, such as a temporary password or API key.

Write-only fields are ephemeral, meaning they are not written to Terraform's state and are only available during the current Terraform run. On a new Terraform operation, the write-only field always start as `null` before Terraform overwrites it with a new value from your configuration.

Write-only fields are unique among other ephemeral constructs in Terraform because you can assign both ephemeral and non-ephemeral data as the value of a write-only field.


<!-- Update with a code sample when we have one -->

<!-- Update once we have a working provider example

Terraform sends write-only fields to the provider every time it needs to create or update that field's resource in your configuration. For example, the `aws_db_instance` resource type has a write-only `password` field:

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
    instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
    username             = "admin"
    # This write-only field is ephemeral, meaning it is not saved in state.
    password             = ephemeral.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.example.secret_string["exampleKey"]
}

ephemeral "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "example" {
  secret_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.example.id
}
```

Every time Terraform creates or updates the `aws_db_instance` resource, Terraform sends the `password` field to the `aws` provider. The provider then uses the value of the `password` field, then discards that value and never stores it in state.
