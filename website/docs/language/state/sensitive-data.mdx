# Sensitive Data in State

Terraform state can contain sensitive data, depending on the resources in use
and your definition of "sensitive." The state contains resource IDs and all
resource attributes unless your mark those resources as [`ephmeral`](#ephemeral-data). For resources such as databases, this may contain initial
passwords.

When using local state, state is stored in plain-text JSON files.

When using [remote state](/terraform/language/state/remote), state is only ever held in memory when used by Terraform. It may be encrypted at rest, but this depends on the specific remote state backend.

## Ephemeral data

-> **Note**: Ephmeral values are in public beta, and the workflows and API of ephemeral values may change.

Terraform allows you to mark `input` variables, `outputs` variables, and `resources` as ephemeral.  Marking sensitive data as `ephmeral` tells Terraform that the data is available during runtime, but Terraform should not write data to state or plan files. The `ephmeral` property is useful if you are managing credentials, tokens, or other temporary resources that you do not want to store in Terraform state files.

Learn more about defining `ephemeral` [output variables](/terraform/language/values/outputs#ephemeral), [input variables](/terraform/language/values/varibales#ephemeral), and [resources]().

## Recommendations

If you manage any sensitive data with Terraform (like database passwords, user
passwords, or private keys) that isn't marked as `ephemeral`, then treat the state itself as sensitive data.

Storing state remotely can provide better security. As of Terraform 0.9,
Terraform does not persist state to the local disk when remote state is in use,
and some backends can be configured to encrypt the state data at rest.

For example:

- [HCP Terraform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) always encrypts state at rest and
  protects it with TLS in transit. HCP Terraform also knows the identity of
  the user requesting state and maintains a history of state changes. This can
  be used to control access and track activity. [Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise)
  also supports detailed audit logging.
- The S3 backend supports encryption at rest when the `encrypt` option is
  enabled. IAM policies and logging can be used to identify any invalid access.
  Requests for the state go over a TLS connection.
- The GCS (Google Cloud Storage) backend supports using [customer-supplied](/terraform/language/backend/gcs#customer-supplied-encryption-keys) or [customer-managed (Cloud KMS)](/terraform/language/backend/gcs#customer-managed-encryption-keys-cloud-kms) encryption keys.
