# Splat Expressions

A _splat expression_ provides a more concise way to express a common
operation that could otherwise be performed with a `for` expression.

If `var.list` is a list of objects that all have an attribute `id`, then
a list of the ids could be produced with the following `for` expression:

```hcl
[for o in var.list : o.id]
```

This is equivalent to the following _splat expression:_

```hcl
var.list[*].id
```

The special `[*]` symbol iterates over all of the elements of the list given
to its left and accesses from each one the attribute name given on its
right. A splat expression can also be used to access attributes and indexes
from lists of complex types by extending the sequence of operations to the
right of the symbol:

```hcl
var.list[*].interfaces[0].name
```

The above expression is equivalent to the following `for` expression:

```hcl
[for o in var.list : o.interfaces[0].name]
```

## Splat Expressions with Maps

The splat expression patterns shown above apply only to lists, sets, and
tuples. To get a similar result with a map or object value you must use
[`for` expressions](/terraform/language/expressions/for).

Resources that use the `for_each` argument will appear in expressions as a map
of objects, so you can't use splat expressions with those resources.
For more information, see
[Referring to Resource Instances](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each#referring-to-instances).

## Single Values as Lists

Splat expressions have a special behavior when you apply them to a value that
isn't a list, set, or tuple.

If the value is anything other than a null value then the splat expression will
transform it into a single-element list, or more accurately a single-element
tuple value. If the value is _null_ then the splat expression will return an
empty tuple.

This special behavior can be useful for modules that accept optional input
variables whose default value is `null` to represent the absence of any value. This allows the module to adapt the variable value for Terraform language features designed to work with collections. For example:

```hcl
variable "website_setting" {
  type = object({
    index_document = string
    error_document = string
  })
  default = null
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  # ...

  dynamic "website" {
    for_each = var.website_setting[*]
    content {
      index_document = website.value.index_document
      error_document = website.value.error_document
    }
  }
}
```

The above example uses a [`dynamic` block](/terraform/language/expressions/dynamic-blocks), which
generates zero or more nested blocks based on a collection value. The input
variable `var.website_setting` is defined as a single object that might be null,
so the `dynamic` block's `for_each` expression uses `[*]` to ensure that
there will be one block if the module caller sets the website argument, or
zero blocks if the caller leaves it set to null.

This special behavior of splat expressions is not obvious to an unfamiliar
reader, so we recommend using it only in `for_each` arguments and similar
situations where the context implies working with a collection. Otherwise,
the meaning of the expression may be unclear to future readers.

## Legacy (Attribute-only) Splat Expressions

Earlier versions of the Terraform language had a slightly different version
of splat expressions, which Terraform continues to support for backward
compatibility. This older variant is less useful than the modern form described
above, and so we recommend against using it in new configurations.

The legacy "attribute-only" splat expressions use the sequence `.*`, instead of
`[*]`:

```
var.list.*.interfaces[0].name
```

This form has a subtly different behavior, equivalent to the following
`for` expression:

```
[for o in var.list : o.interfaces][0].name
```

Notice that with the attribute-only splat expression the index operation
`[0]` is applied to the result of the iteration, rather than as part of
the iteration itself. Only the attribute lookups apply to each element of
the input. This limitation was confusing some people using older versions of
Terraform and so we recommend always using the new-style splat expressions,
with `[*]`, to get the more consistent behavior.
