# `dynamic` Blocks

Within top-level block constructs like resources, expressions can usually be
used only when assigning a value to an argument using the `name = expression`
form. This covers many uses, but some resource types include repeatable _nested
blocks_ in their arguments, which typically represent separate objects that
are related to (or embedded within) the containing object:

```hcl
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment" "tfenvtest" {
  name = "tf-test-name" # can use expressions here

  setting {
    # but the "setting" block is always a literal block
  }
}
```

You can dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks like `setting` using a
special `dynamic` block type, which is supported inside `resource`, `data`,
`provider`, and `provisioner` blocks:

```hcl
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment" "tfenvtest" {
  name                = "tf-test-name"
  application         = aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.tftest.name
  solution_stack_name = "64bit Amazon Linux 2018.03 v2.11.4 running Go 1.12.6"

  dynamic "setting" {
    for_each = var.settings
    content {
      namespace = setting.value["namespace"]
      name = setting.value["name"]
      value = setting.value["value"]
    }
  }
}
```

A `dynamic` block acts much like a [`for` expression](/terraform/language/expressions/for), but produces
nested blocks instead of a complex typed value. It iterates over a given
complex value, and generates a nested block for each element of that complex
value.

- The label of the dynamic block (`"setting"` in the example above) specifies
  what kind of nested block to generate.
- The `for_each` argument provides the complex value to iterate over.
- The `iterator` argument (optional) sets the name of a temporary variable
  that represents the current element of the complex value. If omitted, the name
  of the variable defaults to the label of the `dynamic` block (`"setting"` in
  the example above).
- The `labels` argument (optional) is a list of strings that specifies the block
  labels, in order, to use for each generated block. You can use the temporary
  iterator variable in this value.
- The nested `content` block defines the body of each generated block. You can
  use the temporary iterator variable inside this block.

Since the `for_each` argument accepts any collection or structural value,
you can use a `for` expression or splat expression to transform an existing
collection.

The iterator object (`setting` in the example above) has two attributes:

- `key` is the map key or list element index for the current element. If the
  `for_each` expression produces a _set_ value then `key` is identical to
  `value` and should not be used.
- `value` is the value of the current element.

A `dynamic` block can only generate arguments that belong to the resource type,
data source, provider or provisioner being configured. It is _not_ possible
to generate meta-argument blocks such as `lifecycle` and `provisioner`
blocks, since Terraform must process these before it is safe to evaluate
expressions.

The `for_each` value must be a collection with one element per desired
nested block. If you need to declare resource instances based on a nested
data structure or combinations of elements from multiple data structures you
can use Terraform expressions and functions to derive a suitable value.
For some common examples of such situations, see the
[`flatten`](/terraform/language/functions/flatten)
and
[`setproduct`](/terraform/language/functions/setproduct)
functions.

## Multi-level Nested Block Structures

Some providers define resource types that include multiple levels of blocks
nested inside one another. You can generate these nested structures dynamically
when necessary by nesting `dynamic` blocks in the `content` portion of other
`dynamic` blocks.

For example, a module might accept a complex data structure like the following:

```hcl
variable "load_balancer_origin_groups" {
  type = map(object({
    origins = set(object({
      hostname = string
    }))
  }))
}
```

If you were defining a resource whose type expects a block for each origin
group and then nested blocks for each origin within a group, you could ask
Terraform to generate that dynamically using the following nested `dynamic`
blocks:

```hcl
  dynamic "origin_group" {
    for_each = var.load_balancer_origin_groups
    content {
      name = origin_group.key

      dynamic "origin" {
        for_each = origin_group.value.origins
        content {
          hostname = origin.value.hostname
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

When using nested `dynamic` blocks it's particularly important to pay attention
to the iterator symbol for each block. In the above example,
`origin_group.value` refers to the current element of the outer block, while
`origin.value` refers to the current element of the inner block.

If a particular resource type defines nested blocks that have the same type
name as one of their parents, you can use the `iterator` argument in each of
`dynamic` blocks to choose a different iterator symbol that makes the two
easier to distinguish.

## Best Practices for `dynamic` Blocks

Overuse of `dynamic` blocks can make configuration hard to read and maintain, so
we recommend using them only when you need to hide details in order to build a
clean user interface for a re-usable module. Always write nested blocks out
literally where possible.

If you find yourself defining most or all of a `resource` block's arguments and
nested blocks using directly-corresponding attributes from an input variable
then that might suggest that your module is not creating a useful abstraction.
It may be better for the calling module to define the resource itself then
pass information about it into your module. For more information on this design
tradeoff, see [When to Write a Module](/terraform/language/modules/develop#when-to-write-a-module)
and [Module Composition](/terraform/language/modules/develop/composition).
