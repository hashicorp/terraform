# Conditional Expressions

A _conditional expression_ uses the value of a boolean expression to select one of
two values.

## Syntax

The syntax of a conditional expression is as follows:

```hcl
condition ? true_val : false_val
```

If `condition` is `true` then the result is `true_val`. If `condition` is
`false` then the result is `false_val`.

A common use of conditional expressions is to define defaults to replace
invalid values:

```
var.a != "" ? var.a : "default-a"
```

If `var.a` is an empty string then the result is `"default-a"`, but otherwise
it is the actual value of `var.a`.

## Conditions

The condition can be any expression that resolves to a boolean value. This will
usually be an expression that uses the equality, comparison, or logical
operators.

The following language features are particularly useful when writing condition expressions.

### `contains` Function

Use the built-in function `contains` to test whether a given value is one of a set of predefined valid values.

```hcl
  condition = contains(["STAGE", "PROD"], var.environment)
```

### Boolean Operators

Use the boolean operators `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) to combine multiple conditions together.

```hcl
  condition = var.name != "" && lower(var.name) == var.name
  ```

### `length` Function

Require a non-empty list or map by testing the collection's length.

```hcl
  condition = length(var.items) != 0
```
This is a better approach than directly comparing with another collection using `==` or `!=`. This is because the comparison operators can only return `true` if both operands have exactly the same type, which is often ambiguous for empty collections.

### `for` Expressions

Use `for` expressions in conjunction with the functions `alltrue` and `anytrue` to test whether a condition holds for all or for any elements of a collection.

```hcl
  condition = alltrue([
    for v in var.instances : contains(["t2.micro", "m3.medium"], v.type)
  ])
```

### `can` Function

Use the `can` function to concisely use the validity of an expression as a condition. It returns `true` if its given expression evaluates successfully and `false` if it returns any error, so you can use various other functions that typically return errors as a part of your condition expressions.

For example, you can use `can` with `regex` to test if a string matches a particular pattern because `regex` returns an error when given a non-matching string.

```hcl
  condition = can(regex("^[a-z]+$", var.name)
```

You can also use `can` with the type conversion functions to test whether a value is convertible to a type or type constraint.

```hcl
  # This remote output value must have a value that can
  # be used as a string, which includes strings themselves
  # but also allows numbers and boolean values.
  condition = can(tostring(data.terraform_remote_state.example.outputs["name"]))
```

```hcl
  # This remote output value must be convertible to a list
  # type of with element type.
  condition = can(tolist(data.terraform_remote_state.example.outputs["items"]))
```

You can also use `can` with attribute access or index operators to test whether a collection or structural value has a particular element or index.

```hcl
  # var.example must have an attribute named "foo"
  condition = can(var.example.foo)  ```

```hcl
  # var.example must be a sequence with at least one element
  condition = can(var.example[0])
  # (although it would typically be clearer to write this as a
  # test like length(var.example) > 0 to better represent the
  # intent of the condition.)
```

### `self` Object

Use the `self` object in postcondition blocks to refer to attributes of the instance under evaluation.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami           = "ami-abc123"

  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = self.instance_state == "running"
      error_message = "EC2 instance must be running."
    }
  }
}
```

### `each` and `count` Objects

In blocks where `for_each` or `count` are set, use `each` and `count` objects to refer to other resources that are expanded in a chain.

```hcl
variable "vpc_cidrs" {
  type = set(string)
}

data "aws_vpc" "example" {
  for_each = var.vpc_cidrs

  filter {
    name   = "cidr"
    values = [each.key]
  }
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "example" {
  for_each = aws_vpc.example
  vpc_id = each.value.id

  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition     = aws_vpc.example[each.key].state == "available"
      error_message = "VPC ${each.key} must be available."
    }
  }
}
```

## Result Types

The two result values may be of any type, but they must both
be of the _same_ type so that Terraform can determine what type the whole
conditional expression will return without knowing the condition value.

If the two result expressions don't produce the same type then Terraform will
attempt to find a type that they can both convert to, and make those
conversions automatically if so.

For example, the following expression is valid and will always return a string,
because in Terraform all numbers can convert automatically to a string using
decimal digits:

```hcl
var.example ? 12 : "hello"
```

Relying on this automatic conversion behavior can be confusing for those who
are not familiar with Terraform's conversion rules though, so we recommend
being explicit using type conversion functions in any situation where there may
be some uncertainty about the expected result type.

The following example is contrived because it would be easier to write the
constant `"12"` instead of the type conversion in this case, but shows how to
use [`tostring`](/language/functions/tostring) to explicitly convert a number to
a string.

```hcl
var.example ? tostring(12) : "hello"
```
