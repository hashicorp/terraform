# Set conditions for deployment plans

Orchestration rules allow you to automate aspects of your Stack deployments, such as auto-approving plans when those plans meet certain conditions. By setting orchestration rules, you can help streamline managing many deployments.

## Create orchestration rules

Add `orchestrate` blocks to define rules for handling deployment plans in your deployment configuration file (`tfdeploy.hcl`).

The `orchestrate` block uses a `check` block to determine if a condition has passed or not, and every condition must pass for the `orchestrate` rule to take effect. For details on the syntax of an `orchestrate` block, refer to the [Deployment configuration file reference](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfdeploy).

### Orchestrate rule types

There are two orchestration rule types to choose from:

1. The `auto_approve` rule executes after a Stack creates a plan and automatically approves a plan if all checks pass.  
1. The `replan` rule executes after a Stack applies a plan, automatically triggering a replan if all the checks pass.

The `auto_approve` rule is helpful when you know you want a certain type of plan to go ahead without manual intervention. For example, Stacks have a default `auto_approve` rule named `empty_plan`, which automatically approves a plan if it has no changes. 

As another example, you could create a rule that automatically approves deployments if a component has not changed. 

```hcl
# deployments.tfdeploy.hcl

orchestrate "auto_approve" "no_pet_changes" {
    check {
        # Check that the pet component has no changes
        condition = context.plan.component_changes["component.pet"].total == 0
        reason = "Not automatically approved because changes proposed to pet component."
    }
}
```

The above `orchestrate` block automatically approves plans if they do not include any changes for the `pet` component. 

The `replan` rule is helpful when you need your Stack to perform another plan after it applies the last one. You could create a rule to automatically replan a deployment if the production deployment errors out.

```hcl
# deployments.tfdeploy.hcl

orchestrate "replan" "replan_prod_for_errors" {
    check {
        condition = context.plan.deployment == deployment.production
        reason = "Only automatically replan production deployments."
    }

    check {
        condition = context.plan.applyable == false
        reason = "Only automatically replan plans that were not applyable."
    }

    check {
        condition = context.plan.replans < 2
        reason = "Only automatically replan failed plans once."
    }
}
```

The above `orchestrate` block triggers a replan if the production development of a Stack errors out and if HCP Terraform hasn't already attempted to replan.

### Leverage orchestration context

The `orchestrate` block can use the `context` variable, which provides access to detailed information about the deployment plan, such as the number of changes, the specific components involved, and the deploymentâ€™s status.

Use `context` to create more sophisticated checks and conditions. For example, you can automatically approve all planning operations.

```hcl
# deployments.tfdeploy.hcl

orchestrate "auto_approve" "no_pet_changes" {
    check {
        # Check that the pet component has no changes
        condition = context.operation == "plan"
        reason = "Apply operations need manual approval."
    }
}
```

Another example of using `context` is automatically approving plans that do not remove resources in non-production deployments.

```hcl
# deployments.tfdeploy.hcl
orchestrate "auto_approve" "safe_plans" {
    # Ensure that no resource is removed.
    check {
        condition = context.plan.changes.remove == 0
        reason    = "Plan is destroying ${context.plan.changes.remove} resources."
    }

    # Ensure that the deployment is not your production environment. 
    check {
        condition = context.plan.deployment != deployment.production
        reason    = "Production plans are not eligible for auto_approve."
    }
}
```

For more information on the information available in the context variable, refer to the [Deployment configuration file reference](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfdeploy).
 
## Next steps

With your Stack and deployment configurations complete, your Stack is ready to be deployed by HCP Terraform. To learn more about creating a Stack in HCP Terraform, refer to [Create a Stack](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/create).
