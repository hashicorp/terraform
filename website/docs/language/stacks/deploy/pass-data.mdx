# Pass data from one Stack to another

If you have multiple Stacks that do not share a provisioning lifecycle, you can export data from one Stack for another Stack to consume. If the output value of a Stack changes after a run, HCP Terraform automatically triggers runs for any Stacks that depend on those outputs.


## Background

You may need to pass data between different Stacks in your project. For example, one Stack in your organization may manage shared services, such as networking infrastructure, and another Stack may manage application components. Using separate Stacks lets you manage the infrastructure independently, but you may still need to share data from your networking Stack to your application Stack.

To output information from a Stack, declare a `publish_output` block in the deployment configuration of the Stack exporting data. We refer to the Stack that declares a `publish_output` block as the upstream Stack.

To consume the data exported by the upstream Stack, declare an `upstream_input` block in the deployment configuration of a different Stack in the same project. We refer to the Stack that declares an `upstream_input` block as the downstream Stack.

## Requirements

The `publish_output` and `upstream_input` blocks require at least Terraform version `terraform_1.10.0-alpha20241009` or higher. Download the [latest version of Terraform](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/) to use the most up-to-date functionality.

Downstream Stacks must also reside in the same project as their upstream Stacks.

## Declare outputs

You must declare a `publish_output` block in your deployment configuration for each value you want to output from your current Stack.

For example, you can add a `publish_output` block for the `vpc_id`  in your upstream Stack’s deployment configuration. You can directly reference a deployment's values with the `deployment.deployment_name` syntax.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="network.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
# Networking Stack deployment configuration

publish_output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The networking Stack's VPC's ID."
  value       = deployment.network.vpc_id
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

After applying your configuration, any Stack in the same project can now reference your network deployment's `vpc_id` output by declaring an `upstream_input` block.

Once you apply a Stack configuration version that includes your `publish_output` block, HCP Terraform publishes a snapshot of those values, which allows HCP Terraform to resolve them. Meaning, you must apply your Stack’s deployment configuration before any downstream Stacks can reference your Stack's outputs.

Learn more about the [`publish_output` block](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfdeploy#publish_output-block-configuration).

## Consume the output from an upstream Stack

Declare an `upstream_input` block in your Stack’s deployment configuration to read values from another Stack's `publish_output` block. Adding an `upstream_input` block creates a dependency on the upstream Stack.

For example, if you want to use the output `vpc_id` from an upstream Stack in the same project, declare an `upstream_input` block in your deployment configuration.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="application.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
# Application Stack deployment configuration

upstream_input "network_stack" {
  type   = "stack"
  source = "app.terraform.io/hashicorp/Default Project/networking-stack"
}

deployment "application" {
  inputs = {
    vpc_id = upstream_input.network_stack.vpc_id
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

After pushing your Stack's configuration into HCP Terraform, HCP Terraform searches for the most recently published snapshot of the upstream Stack your configuration references. If no snapshot exists, the downstream Stack's run fails.

If HCP Terraform finds a published snapshot for your referenced upstream Stack, then all of that Stack's outputs are available to this downstream Stack. Add `upstream_input` blocks for every upstream Stack you want to reference. Learn more about the [`upstream_input` block](/terraform/language/stacks/reference/tfdeploy#upstream_input-block-configuration).


## Trigger runs when output values change

If an upstream Stack's published output values change, HCP Terraform automatically triggers runs for any downstream Stacks that rely on those outputs.

In the following example, the `application` deployment depends on the upstream networking Stack.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="application.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
# Application Stack deployment configuration

upstream_input "network_stack" {
  type   = "stack"
  source = "app.terraform.io/hashicorp/Default Project/networking-stack"
}

deployment "application" {
  inputs = {
    vpc_id = upstream_input.network_stack.vpc_id
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The application Stack depends on the networking Stack’s output, so if the `vpc_id` changes then HCP Terraform triggers a new run for the application Stack. This approach allows you to decouple Stacks that have separate life cycles and ensures that updates in an upstream Stack propagate to downstream Stacks.

## Remove upstream Stack dependencies

To stop depending on an upstream Stack’s outputs, do the following in your downstream Stack's deployment configuration:

1. Remove the upstream Stack's `upstream_input` block
1. Remove any references to the upstream Stack's outputs
1. Push your configuration changes to HCP Terraform and apply the new configuration
