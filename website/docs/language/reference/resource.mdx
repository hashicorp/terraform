# `resource` block

This topic provides reference information about the `resource` block in the Terraform configuration language. 

## Introduction

Add `resource` blocks to your Terraform configuration to describe one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records. Specific arguments that you can define in your configuration depend on the providers you import. 

Refer to the following topics for additional information:

- [usage topic about configuring the resource block]()
- [usage topic about configuring the provider block]()
- [provider block reference]()

## Configuration model

The following list provides an overview of the attributes you can declare in the `resource` block:

- [`resource "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#resource): map 
  - [`<PROVIDER_ARGUMENTS>`](#provider_arguments): arguments specific to the installed provider
  - [`count`](#resource-count): number 
  - [`depends_on`](#resource-depends_on): list or references
  - [`for_each`](#resource-for_each):  function
    - [`tomap()`](#resource-for_each): map of key-value pairs
    - [`toset()`](#resource-for_each): list of string values 
  - [`provider`](#resource-provider): reference
  - [`lifecycle`](#resource-lifecycle): map
    - [`create_before_destroy`](#resource-lifecycle): boolean
    - [`prevent_destroy`](#resource-lifecycle): boolean
    - [`ignore_changes`](#resource-lifecycle): list of attribute names
    - [`replace_triggered_by`](#resource-lifecycle): list of references
    - [`precondition`](#resource-lifecycle): map
    - [`postcondition`](#resource-lifecycle): map
- [`provisioner "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#resource-provisioner): map 


## Specification

This section provides details about the arguments you can configure in the `resource` block. Specific providers and backends may support additional fields.

### `resource`

The main `resource` block accepts the following attributes:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the type of resource you can declare depends on the provider you import. Refer to the documentation for your provider for details. You can also specify the `terraform_data` resource type to implement a standard resource lifecycle. Refer to [Implement the standard resource lifecycle](linky-link) for additional information
- `LABEL`: Specifies an arbitrary name for the resource that you can use to reference the resource from other configuration elements. Refer to [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) in the style guide for label recommendations.

- Data type: Map
- Default: None

### `PROVIDER_ARGUMENTS`

Specific arguments that you can define in your configuration depend on the providers you import. Refer to the documentation for your provider for details.  

- Data type: Determined by provider
- Default: None

### `resource{}.count`

Meta-argument that instructs Terraform to provision the number of identical resources specified. Additional information. Refer to the [`count` meta-argument reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details. 

- Data type: Number. 
- Default: Terraform provisions a single instance of the resource.

### `resource{}.depends_on`

Meta-argument that explicitly describes dependencies for objects in the configuration. Use this argument when a resource or module relies on another resource's behavior but does not access any of the resource's data in its arguments. Refer to the [`depends_on` meta-argument reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for details.  

- Data type: List of references to other resources in the configuration. 
- Default: Terraform follows the standard resrouce dependency graph by default. Refer to [Resource graph](/terraform/internals/graph) for additional information.

### `resource{}.for_each`

Meta-argument that instructs Terraform to provision a set of similar resources that are the same type. The `for_each` argument accepts one of the following functions:

- `tomap()`: You can pass a map of key-value pairs to into the function. Terraform provisions a unique instance of the resource for each pair.  
- `tolist()`: You can pass a list of strings to into the function. Terraform provisions a unique instance of the resource for string. 

Refer to the [`for_each` meta-argument reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details.  

- Data type: Function containing a set of parameters. 
- Default: Terraform provisions a single instance of the resource.

### `resource{}.provider`

Meta-argument that instructs Terraform to use an alternate provider configuration to provision the resource. Instead of creating separate configuration files for each resource, you can define multiple `provider` block configurations and use this argument to implement a different configuration for each `resource` block. Refer to the [`provider` meta-argument reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/provider) for details.  

- Data type: Reference to a provider configuration alias.
- Default: When the configuration contains multiple versions of the same provider configuration, Terraform applies the first configuration by default. 

### `resource{}.lifecycle`

Meta-argument that specifies the infrastructure resource lifecycle. You can specify the following types of lifecycles:

- `creat_before_destroy`: Terraform creates a replacement object before destroying the previous object.
- `prevent_destroy`: Terraform rejects operations that destroy infrastructure objects associated with the resource and returns an error.
- `ignore_changes`: Terraform ingores changes to the resource configuration. As a result, the remote resource under management remains unchanged.
- `replace_triggered_by`: Terraform replaces the resource when any of the specified items change.
- `precondition`: Specifies an existing condition that triggers a check on the resource. Refer to [Create checks](linky-ti-link) for additional information.
- `postcondition`: Specifies a condition that emerges after a Terraform operation that triggers a check on the resource. Refer to [Create checks](linky-ti-link) for additional information.

Refer to the [`lifecycle` meta-argument reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) for details.  

- Data type: Map containing an argument.
- Default: Terraform applies the standard lifecycle. Refer to [Apply the standard lifecylce](#) for additional information.

### `resource{}.provisioner`

A set of arguments that let you modle specific actions on the local or remote machine, such as preparing servers or other infrastructure objects for service. The `provisioner` argument has the following attributes:

- `TYPE`: Specifies one of the following provisioner types:
  - `file`: Copies files or directories form the machine where Terraform is running to the new resource.
  - `local-exec`: Invokes an executable on the local machine after Terraform creates the resource.
  - `remote-exec`: Invokes an executable on the remote resource after Terraform creates the resource.  
- `LABEL`: Optional attribute for adding a unique name. Refer to [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) in the style guide for label recommendations.

Refer to the [`provisioner` block reference]() for additional information.

- Data type: Map
- Default: None

## Examples

The following examples describe common patterns for specific use cases.

### Define an AWS instance

The following example defines an `aws_instance` resource named `web`. 

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
