# Monitoring & System Management Providers

This is a group of monitoring & system management providers that offer the
capability to configure and manage services such as loggers, metric tools,
and monitoring services. Terraform integrates with these services using the
specific provider to enable these specialized monitoring capabilities. These
providers are primarily supported by the vendor in close collaboration with
HashiCorp, and are tested by HashiCorp.
