#Cloud Providers

This group includes cloud providers offering a range of services including IaaS,
SaaS, and PaaS offerings. This group of cloud providers includes some smaller
scale clouds or ones with more specialized offerings. The Terraform provider
and associated resources for these clouds are primarily supported by the cloud
vendor in close collaboration with HashiCorp, and are tested by HashiCorp.
