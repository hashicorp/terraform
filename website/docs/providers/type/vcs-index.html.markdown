# Version Control Providers

This is a group of Version Control System (VCS) providers that offer
capabilities of using Terraform to manage your VCS projects, teams and
repositories. Terraform integrates with these services to create and manage
resources provided by the VCS. These providers are primarily supported by the
vendor in close collaboration with HashiCorp, and are tested by HashiCorp.
