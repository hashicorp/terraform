# Major Cloud Providers

This group includes hyper-scale cloud providers that offer a range of services
including IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS.  A large percentage of Terraform users provision
their infrastructure on these major cloud providers. HashiCorp closely partners
with these cloud providers to offer best-in-class integration to provision and
manage the majority of the services offered. These providers are primarily
supported by the cloud vendor in close collaboration with HashiCorp, and are
tested by HashiCorp.
