# Writing and Modifying Terraform Code

The [Terraform language](/terraform/language) is Terraform's primary
user interface, and all of Terraform's workflows rely on configurations written
in the Terraform language.

Terraform CLI includes several commands to make Terraform code more convenient
to work with. The following commands can be integrated into your editing 
workflow and may save you time and effort:

- [`terraform console`](/terraform/cli/commands/console): Start an 
  interactive shell for evaluating Terraform
  [expressions](/terraform/language/expressions) to quickly verify that a 
  particular resource argument results in the value you expect.

- [`terraform fmt`](/terraform/cli/commands/fmt): Rewrite Terraform
  configuration files to a canonical format and style, so you don't have to
  waste time making minor adjustments for readability and consistency. `fmt` works
  well as a pre-commit hook in your version control system.

- [`terraform validate`](/terraform/cli/commands/validate): Validate the
  syntax and arguments of the Terraform configuration files in a directory,
  including argument and attribute names and types for resources and modules.
  The `plan` and `apply` commands automatically validate a configuration before
  performing any other work. `validate` isn't a crucial part of the core
  workflow but can be very useful as a pre-commit hook or as part of a
  continuous integration pipeline.

- [`0.13upgrade`](/terraform/cli/commands/0.13upgrade) and
  [`0.12upgrade`](/terraform/cli/commands/0.12upgrade): Modify the configuration files in a Terraform module automatically to help deal with major
  syntax changes that occurred in the 0.13 and 0.12 releases of Terraform. Both
  commands are only available in the Terraform version they are
  associated with. Make sure to upgrade older code to be compatible
  with 0.12 before attempting to make it compatible with 0.13. For more detailed
  information about updating code for new Terraform versions, see the [upgrade
  guides](/terraform/language/upgrade-guides).
