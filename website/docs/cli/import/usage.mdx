# Import existing resources

This topic describes how to use the `terraform import` command to import existing infrastructure resources so that you can manage them as code.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Import Terraform Configuration](/terraform/tutorials/state/state-import?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

## Overview

Use the `terraform import` command to import existing infrastructure to Terraform state. The `terraform import` command can only import one resource at a time. It cannot simultaneously import an entire collection of resources, such as an AWS VPC.

Complete the following steps to import resources:

1. Add the resource you want to manage with Terraform to your Terraform configuration.
1. Run the `terraform import` command.


~> Warning: Terraform expects that each remote object it is managing will be
bound to only one resource address, which is normally guaranteed by Terraform
itself having created all objects. If you import existing objects into Terraform,
be careful to import each remote object to only one Terraform resource address.
If you import the same object multiple times, Terraform may exhibit unwanted
behavior. For more information on this assumption, see
[the State section](/terraform/language/state).

## Add the resource to your configuration

Write a resource block for the resource you want to import in your configuration. 
Provide a name for the resource, which is a unique ID that you can use to reference the resource elsewhere in the configuration.

In the following example, the imported resource is an AWS instance named `example`:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # ...instance configuration...
}
```

You do not have to complete the body of the resource block. Instead, you can finish defining arguments after the instance is imported.

## Run the `terraform import` command

Run `terraform import` to attach an existing instance to the
resource configuration:

```shell
$ terraform import aws_instance.example i-abcd1234
```

This command locates the AWS EC2 instance with ID `i-abcd1234`. Then it attaches
the existing settings of the instance, as described by the EC2 API, to the
name `aws_instance.example` of a module. In this example, the module path
implies that the root module is used. Finally, the mapping is saved in the
Terraform state.

It is also possible to import to resources in child modules, using their paths,
and to single instances of a resource with `count` or `for_each` set. See
[_Resource Addressing_](/terraform/cli/state/resource-addressing) for more
details on how to specify a target resource.

The syntax of the given ID is dependent on the resource type being imported.
For example, AWS instances use an opaque ID issued by the EC2 API, but
AWS Route53 Zones use the domain name itself. Consult the documentation for
each importable resource for details on what form of ID is required.

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
You can now run `terraform plan` to see how the configuration compares to
the imported resource, and make any adjustments to the configuration to
align with the current (or desired) state of the imported object.

## Complex Imports

The above import is considered a "simple import": one resource is imported
into the state file. An import may also result in a "complex import" where
multiple resources are imported. For example, an AWS network ACL imports
an `aws_network_acl` but also one `aws_network_acl_rule` for each rule.

In this scenario, the secondary resources will not already exist in
the configuration, so it is necessary to consult the import output and create
a `resource` block in the configuration for each secondary resource. If this is
not done, Terraform will plan to destroy the imported objects on the next run.

If you want to rename or otherwise move the imported resources, the
[state management commands](/terraform/cli/commands/state) can be used.
