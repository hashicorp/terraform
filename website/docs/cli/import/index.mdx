# Import

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Import Terraform Configuration](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/state-import?in=terraform/state&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Terraform can import existing infrastructure resources. This functionality lets you bring existing resources under Terraform management.

~> Warning: Terraform expects that each remote object is bound to only one resource address. You should import each remote object to only one Terraform resource address. If you import the same object multiple times, Terraform may exhibit unwanted behavior. Refer to [State](/language/state) for more details.
=======
Terraform can import existing infrastructure resources. This functionality allows you take
resources you created by some other means and bring them under Terraform
management.

This is a great way to slowly transition infrastructure to Terraform, or
to be able to be confident that you can use Terraform in the future if it
potentially doesn't support every feature you need today.

~> Warning: Terraform expects that each remote object it is managing will be
bound to only one resource address, which is normally guaranteed by Terraform
itself having created all objects. If you import existing objects into Terraform,
be careful to import each remote object to only one Terraform resource address.
If you import the same object multiple times, Terraform may exhibit unwanted
behavior. For more information on this assumption, see
[the State section](/language/state).

## Currently State Only

<<<<<<< HEAD
Terraform import can only import resources into the [state](/language/state). Importing does not generate configuration.

Before you run `terraform import` you must manually write a `resource` configuration block for the resource. The resource block describes where Terraform should map the imported object.

## Terraform Cloud

When you use Terraform on the command line with Terraform Cloud, many commands like `apply` run inside your Terraform Cloud environment. However, the `import` command runs locally, so it does not have access to information from Terraform Cloud. To successfully perform an import, you may need to set local variables equivalent to any remote workspace variables in Terraform Cloud.
=======
The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources
into the [state](/language/state). It does not generate configuration. A future
version of Terraform will also generate configuration.

Because of this, prior to running `terraform import` it is necessary to write
manually a `resource` configuration block for the resource, to which the
imported object will be mapped.

While this may seem tedious, it still gives Terraform users an avenue for
importing existing resources.

## Terraform Cloud

When you use Terraform on the command line with Terraform Cloud, many commands (e.g., `apply`) run inside your Terraform Cloud environment. However, the `import` command runs locally, so it will not have access to information from Terraform Cloud. To successfully perform an import, you may need to set local variables equivalent to any remote workspace variables in Terraform Cloud.
