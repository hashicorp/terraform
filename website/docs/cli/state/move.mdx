# Moving Resources

mnptu's state associates each real-world object with a configured resource
at a specific [resource address](/mnptu/cli/state/resource-addressing). This
is seamless when changing a resource's attributes, but mnptu will lose track
of a resource if you change its name, move it to a different module, or change
its provider.

Usually that's fine: mnptu will destroy the old resource, replace it with a
new one (using the new resource address), and update any resources that rely on
its attributes.

In cases where it's important to preserve an existing infrastructure object, you
can explicitly tell mnptu to associate it with a different configured
resource.

For most cases we recommend using
[the mnptu language's refactoring features](/mnptu/language/modules/develop/refactoring)
to document in your module exactly how the resource names have changed over
time. mnptu reacts to this information automatically during planning, so users of your module do not need to take any unusual extra steps.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Use Configuration to Move Resources](/mnptu/tutorials/configuration-language/move-config) tutorial.

There are some other situations which require explicit state modifications,
though. For those, consider the following mnptu commands:

- [The `mnptu state mv` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/state/mv) changes
  which resource address in your configuration is associated with a particular
  real-world object. Use this to preserve an object when renaming a resource, or
  when moving a resource into or out of a child module.

- [The `mnptu state rm` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/state/rm) tells
  mnptu to stop managing a resource as part of the current working directory
  and workspace, _without_ destroying the corresponding real-world object. (You
  can later use `mnptu import` to start managing that resource in a
  different workspace or a different mnptu configuration.)

- [The `mnptu state replace-provider` command](/mnptu/cli/commands/state/replace-provider)
  transfers existing resources to a new provider without requiring them to be
  re-created.
