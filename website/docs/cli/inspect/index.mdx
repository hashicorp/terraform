# Inspect Infrastructure Commands Overview

Terraform configurations and state data include some highly structured
information about the resources they manage; this includes dependency
information, outputs (which are pieces of generated or discovered data that the
configuration's author considers important enough to surface to users), and
more.

Terraform CLI includes some commands for inspecting or transforming this data.
You can use these to integrate other tools with Terraform's infrastructure data,
or just to gain a deeper or more holistic understanding of your infrastructure.

- [The `terraform graph` command](/terraform/cli/commands/graph) creates a visual
  representation of a configuration or a set of planned changes.
- [The `terraform output` command](/terraform/cli/commands/output) can get the
  values for the top-level [output values](/terraform/language/values/outputs) of
  a configuration, which are often helpful when making use of the infrastructure
  Terraform has provisioned.
- [The `terraform show` command](/terraform/cli/commands/show) can generate
  human-readable versions of a state file or plan file, or generate
  machine-readable versions that can be integrated with other tools.
- [The `terraform state list` command](/terraform/cli/commands/state/list) can list
  the resources being managed by the current working directory and workspace,
  providing a complete or filtered list.
- [The `terraform state show` command](/terraform/cli/commands/state/show) can print
  all of the attributes of a given resource being managed by the current working
  directory and workspace, including generated read-only attributes like the
  unique ID assigned by the cloud provider.
