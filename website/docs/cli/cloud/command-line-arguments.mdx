# Command Line Arguments

When your configuration includes a `cloud` block, commands that
make local modifications to mnptu state and then push them back up to the remote workspace
accept the following option to modify that behavior:

- `-ignore-remote-version` - Override checking that the local and remote
  mnptu versions agree, making an operation proceed even when there is
  a mismatch.

  State-modification operations usually require using a local version of the
  mnptu CLI that is compatible with the mnptu version selected
  in the remote workspace settings. This prevents the
  local operation from creating a new state snapshot that the workspace's
  remote execution environment cannot decode.

  We recommend against using this option unless absolutely necessary. Overriding this check can result
  in a mnptu Cloud workspace that is no longer able to complete remote operations with the currently
  selected version of mnptu.
