This documentation provides reference information about Terraform CLI commands, 
as well as instructions for using commands to provision infrastructure and manage the 
infrastructure lifecyle. It is relevant to anyone working with Terraform's CLI-based 
workflows, including people who use Terraform CLI by itself, as well as those who 
use Terraform CLI in conjunction with HCTP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise.

For information about the Terraform configuration language syntax and coding patters, refer to the
[Terraform configuration language documentation](/terraform/language).
