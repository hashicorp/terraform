# `terraform version` command

The `terraform version` command prints the current version of the Terraform binary and all
installed plugins.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform version [options]`

With no additional arguments, `version` displays the version of Terraform,
the platform it is installed on, installed providers, and the results of upgrade
and security checks unless disabled. Refer to [Upgrade and Security Bulletin Checks](/terraform/cli/commands#upgrade-and-security-bulletin-checks) for additional information.

## Flags

This command has one optional flag:

* `-json` - Formats version information as a JSON object. No upgrade or security information is included.

## Example

Basic usage, with upgrade and security information shown if relevant:

```shellsession
$ terraform version
Terraform v0.15.0
on darwin_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v3.0.0

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is X.Y.Z. You can update by downloading from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
```

As JSON:

```shellsession
$ terraform version -json
{
  "terraform_version": "0.15.0",
  "platform": "darwin_amd64",
  "provider_selections": {
    "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null": "3.0.0"
  },
  "terraform_outdated": true
}
```
