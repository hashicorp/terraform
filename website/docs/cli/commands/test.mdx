# Command: test

The `terraform test` command reads in Terraform testing files and executes the tests within.

The `test` command, and the test file syntax, are particularly helpful for module authors who want to validate and test their shared modules. You can also use the `test` command to validate root modules.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform test [options]`

This command searches the current directory and the specified testing directory (`tests`, by default) for any Terraform testing files, and executes the specified tests. Refer to [Tests](/terraform/language/tests) for more details on test files.

Terraform then executes a series of Terraform plan or apply commands according to the test files' specifications, and also validates the relevant plan and state files according to the test files' specifications.

!> **Warning:** The Terraform test command can create real infrastructure than can cost you money. Refer to the [Terraform Test Cleanup](#terraform-test-cleanup) section for best practices on ensuring created infrastructure is destroyed.

## General Options

The following options apply to the Terraform `test` command:

* `-cloud-run=<module source>` - This test run executes remotely on Terraform Cloud within the specified Terraform [private registry](/terraform/language/modules/sources#terraform-registry) module.

* `-filter=testfile` - Limits the `terraform test` operation to the specified test files.

* `-json` - Displays machine-readable JSON output for your testing results.

* `-test-directory=<relative directory>` - Overrides the directory that Terraform looks into for test files. Note that Terraform always loads testing files within the main configuration directory. The default testing directory is `tests`.

* `-verbose` - Prints out the plan or state for each `run` block within a test file, based on the `command` attribute of each `run` block.

## State Management

Each Terraform test file will maintain all Terraform state it requires within memory as it executes, starting empty. This state is entirely separate from any existing state for the configuration under test, so you can safely execute Terraform test commands without affecting any live infrastructure.

### Terraform Test Cleanup

The Terraform `test` command creates _real_ infrastructure. Once Terraform fully executes each test file, Terraform attempts to destroy any remaining infrastructure. If it cannot do this, Terraform reports a list of resources it created but could not destroy.

You should monitor the output of the test command closely to ensure Terraform removes the infrastructure it created or perform manual cleanup if not. We recommend creating dedicated testing accounts within the target providers that you can routinely and safely purge to ensure any accidental and costly resources aren't left behind.

Terraform also provides diagnostics explaining why it could now automatically clean up. You should resolve these diagnostics to ensure that future clean-up operations are successful.

## Terraform Cloud execution

You can execute tests remotely on Terraform Cloud using the `-cloud-run` option.

The `-cloud-run` option accepts a [private registry module source](/terraform/language/modules/sources#terraform-registry). This option associates the test run with your specified private module within the Terraform Cloud user interface.

You must provide a module from a _private_ registry, not the public Terraform registry.

You must execute [`terraform login`](/terraform/cli/commands/login) before using this option, and ensure that your `hostname` argument matches the private registry hostname of your target module.
