# `terraform logout` command

This topic provides reference information about the `terraform logout` command.

## Introduction

Use the `terraform logout` command to remove credentials stored after running the 
`terraform login` command. These credentials are API tokens for HCP Terraform,
Terraform Enterprise, or any other host that offers Terraform services.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform logout [hostname]`

If you don't provide an explicit hostname, Terraform will assume you want to
log out of HCP Terraform at `app.terraform.io`.

-> **Note:** the API token is only removed from local storage, not destroyed on
the remote server, so it will remain valid until manually revoked.

## Credentials Storage

By default, Terraform will remove the token stored in plain text in a local CLI
configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. If you have configured a
[credentials helper program](/terraform/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers), Terraform
will use the helper's `forget` command to remove it.
