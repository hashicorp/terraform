# Terraform Registry

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) is a repository
of modules written by the Terraform community. The registry can be used to
help you get started with Terraform more quickly, see examples of how
Terraform is written, and find pre-made modules for infrastructure components
you require.

The Terraform Registry is integrated directly into Terraform to make
consuming modules easy. See [the usage information](/docs/registry/modules/use.html#using-modules).

You can also publish your own modules on the Terraform Registry. You may
use the [public registry](https://registry.terraform.io) for public modules.
For private modules, you can use a [Private Registry](/docs/registry/private.html),
or [reference repositories and other sources directly](/docs/modules/sources.html).
Some features are available only for registry modules, such as versioning
and documentation generation.

Use the navigation to the left to learn more about using the registry.
